At first glance, it might not seem like engineering tends to be art, since most engineers claim to be making engineering tradeoffs, rather than aesthetic choices. That, I think, is mostly people lying to themselves. Engineering is a incredibly complicated system, and the vast majority of working engineers do not work in a system with well defined goals, which means that engineering decisions have to be aesthetic — they involve subjective choices about both what goals to prioritize and how to accomplish those goals, and subjective choices are often inherently about beauty.<p>I thought about this a lot while building <a href="https://thoughts.page">thoughts.page</a>, which is mostly a art project that also happens to look like a website or a business.<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="sn-2"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="sn-2" type="checkbox"><span class="sidenote">This did not seem to be well understood when it was posted to Hacker News.</span> Aside from clearly aesthetic choices (all lowercase text everywhere, simple mostly black-and-white design with thick sharp lines), there were also many technical choices that were parimarally artistic. For instance, choosing to implement the main posting page as a html <code>&lt;form&gt;</code> rather than a more modern javascripty thing was driven somewhat by the aesthetic desire for thoughts.page to resemble the early web, in both form and function. The decision to use SQLite was partly a aesthetic decision to make the statement that it would never become a project that would be big enough to be on a more scalable database.<p>I think it’s important to talk about this, because I want more people to make good art, and discovering that you’re making artistic and aesthetic choices is a first step in consciously deciding what sort of art you want to make.</section><section style="text-align:center;padding-top:50px"><p style="font-size:120px;color:#444"><a href="/" class="no-tufte-underline">☙</a></section></article>
