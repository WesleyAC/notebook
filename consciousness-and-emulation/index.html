The first is that it presumes that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physicalism">physicalism</a> is correct, but that’s <a href="/limits-of-science/">fundamentally unprovable</a>. But let’s gloss over that for a second, and take physicalism being correct as a given.<p>There’s a second problem here: what a “simulation” is is rather ill-defined. When looking at computers, we have a relatively easy way of talking about simulation and emulation. A virtual machine can emulate x86 only because there is a detailed x86 specification for it to emulate. Since there is a externally defined specification of what x86 is, we can look at the holistic system of a physical computer running a virtual machine and make statements about which things are happening “in the virtual machine” vs “in the host system”. But with physics, we don’t have anything like that. We still don’t have a holistic model of physics, so we don’t have an easy line that we can draw to say that particular things are “inside” or “outside” a simulation.<p>One could say that a simulation has the property that things inside the simulation cannot affect things outside the simulation, but this typically isn’t true of simulations in the real world, for a variety of reasons (if you’re running a virtual machine, you’re usually making decisions based on the output of the virtual machine, and in any case, operations inside the virtual machine can have effects on the host system like generating heat/noise/etc). And in addition to that, using causality to determine what is a simulation is too restrictive: the insects and plants inside a terrarium, for instance, do not have any more causal impact on what happens outside the glass than a virtual machine has on what happens to the host system, but most people wouldn’t recognize a terrarium as a “simulation”.<p>Merriam-Webster <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/simulation">defines</a> a simulation as:<blockquote><p>The imitative representation of the functioning of one system or process by means of the functioning of another.</blockquote><p>“Imitative representation” is key here. “Imitation” requires something to imitate — we can’t talk of simulation without talking about what is being simulated. A simulation is not an object, but a abstract line we choose to draw in a holistic system. Different ways of drawing that line will allow us different insights about a system, but it’s not useful to ask which side of the line we fall on without first knowing what insight we hope to glean from choosing to draw a line in the first place. In order to usefully talk about whether we’re living in a simulation, we need to figure out what definition of simulation we actually care about, which is actually a really complicated question.</section><section style="text-align:center;padding-top:50px"><p style="font-size:120px;color:#444"><a href="/" class="no-tufte-underline">☙</a></section><section><details class="changelog"><summary class="summarytoggle" title="Changelog"><picture><img alt="changelog" src="/icons/history.svg"></picture></summary><div><time datetime="2021-04-13T13:42:41+0800">13 Apr 2021</time>: <a href="https://github.com/wesleyac/notebook/commit/78e245dcbde88fcea5303de09cd52af7a46e97fe">Initial post</a></div><div><time datetime="2021-04-14T17:35:08+0800">14 Apr 2021</time>: <a href="https://github.com/wesleyac/notebook/commit/7db9a8438139577824469eec6750399cd95e14e8">Fix typo</a></div></details></section></article>
