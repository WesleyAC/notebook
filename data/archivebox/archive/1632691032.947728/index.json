                    "\nThis article is about the term. For the album by John Zorn, see Simulacrum (album).\nA simulacrum (plural: simulacra or simulacrums, from Latin simulacrum, which means \"likeness, semblance\") is a representation or imitation of a person or thing.[1] The word was first recorded in the English language in the late 16th century, used to describe a representation, such as a statue or a painting, especially of a god. By the late 19th century, it had gathered a secondary association of inferiority: an image without the substance or qualities of the original.[2] Literary critic Fredric Jameson offers photorealism as an example of artistic simulacrum, in which a painting is created by copying a photograph that is itself a copy of the real thing.[3] Other art forms that play with simulacra include trompe-l'\u0153il,[4] pop art, Italian neorealism, and French New Wave.[3]\n\n\n\nPhilosophy[edit]\nSimulacra have long been of interest to philosophers. In his Sophist, Plato speaks of two kinds of image-making. The first is a faithful reproduction, attempted to copy precisely the original. The second is intentionally distorted in order to make the copy appear correct to viewers. He gives the example of Greek statuary, which was crafted larger on the top than on the bottom so that viewers on the ground would see it correctly. If they could view it in scale, they would realize it was malformed. This example from the visual arts serves as a metaphor for the philosophical arts and the tendency of some philosophers to distort the truth so that it appears accurate unless viewed from the proper angle.[5] Nietzsche addresses the concept of simulacrum (but does not use the term) in the Twilight of the Idols, suggesting that most philosophers, by ignoring the reliable input of their senses and resorting to the constructs of language and reason, arrive at a distorted copy of reality.[6]\nPostmodernist French social theorist Jean Baudrillard argues that a simulacrum is not a copy of the real, but becomes truth in its own right: the hyperreal. According to Baudrillard, what the simulacrum copies either had no original or no longer has an original, since a simulacrum signifies something it is not, and therefore leaves the original unable to be located. Where Plato saw two types of representation\u2014faithful and intentionally distorted (simulacrum)\u2014Baudrillard sees four: (1) basic reflection of reality; (2) perversion of reality; (3) pretence of reality (where there is no model); and (4) simulacrum, which \"bears no relation to any reality whatsoever\".[7] In Baudrillard's concept, like Nietzsche's, simulacra are perceived as negative, but another modern philosopher who addressed the topic, Gilles Deleuze, takes a different view, seeing simulacra as the avenue by which an accepted ideal or \"privileged position\" could be \"challenged and overturned\".[8] Deleuze defines simulacra as \"those systems in which different relates to different by means of difference itself. What is essential is that we find in these systems no prior identity, no internal resemblance\".[9]\nAlain Badiou, in speaking with reference to Nazism about Evil, writes,[10] \"fidelity to a simulacrum, unlike fidelity to an event, regulates its break with the situation not by the universality of the void, but by the closed particularity of an abstract set ... (the 'Germans' or the 'Aryans')\".\n\nRecreation[edit]\nRecreational simulacra include reenactments of historical events or replicas of landmarks, such as Colonial Williamsburg and the Eiffel Tower, and constructions of fictional or cultural ideas, such as Fantasyland at The Walt Disney Company's Magic Kingdom. The various Disney parks have been regarded as the ultimate recreational simulacra by some philosophers, with Baudrillard noting that Walt Disney World Resort is a copy of a copy, or \"a simulacrum to the second power\".[11] In 1975, Italian author Umberto Eco argued that at Disney's parks, \"we not only enjoy a perfect imitation, we also enjoy the conviction that imitation has reached its apex and afterwards reality will always be inferior to it\".[12] Examining the impact of Disney's simulacrum of national parks, Disney's Wilderness Lodge, environmentalist Jennifer Cypher and anthropologist Eric Higgs expressed worry that \"the boundary between artificiality and reality will become so thin that the artificial will become the centre of moral value\".[13] Eco also refers to commentary on watching sports as sports to the power of three, or sports cubed. First, there are the players who participate in the sport (the real), then the onlookers merely witnessing it, and finally the commentary on the act of witnessing the sport. Visual artist Paul McCarthy has created entire installations based on Pirates of the Caribbean and theme park simulacra, with videos playing inside the installation.\nItalian contemporary artist Holy David is building an online virtual viewing room that resembles the experience of visiting the artist's studio in person on his website and he named it Simulacrum. Visitors and clients can look at Holy David's paintings and learn details as if they were visiting his art studio in person.[14][15]\n\nCaricature[edit]\nAn interesting example of simulacrum is caricature. When an artist produces a line drawing that closely approximates the facial features of a real person, the subject of the sketch cannot be easily identified by a random observer; it can be taken for a likeness of any individual. However, a caricaturist exaggerates prominent facial features, and a viewer will pick up on these features and be able to identify the subject, even though the caricature bears far less actual resemblance to the subject.\n\nIconography[edit]\nBeer (1999: p.\u00a011) employs the term \"simulacrum\" to denote the formation of a sign or iconographic image, whether iconic or aniconic, in the landscape or greater field of Thangka art and Tantric Buddhist iconography. For example, an iconographic representation of a cloud formation sheltering a deity in a thanka or covering the auspice of a sacred mountain in the natural environment may be discerned as a simulacrum of an \"auspicious canopy\" (Sanskrit: Chhatra) of the Ashtamangala.[16] Perceptions of religious imagery in natural phenomena approach a cultural universal and may be proffered as evidence of the natural creative spiritual engagement of the experienced environment endemic to the human psychology.\n\nAs artificial beings[edit]\nSimulacra often appear in speculative fiction. Examples of simulacra in the sense of artificial or supernaturally or scientifically created artificial life forms include:\n\nAutomaton \u2013 A self-operating robot.\nAndroids created to pass for human beings in several of Philip K. Dick's novels (called \"simulacra\" in We Can Build You, The Simulacra, Now Wait for Last Year, Clans of the Alphane Moon, The Penultimate Truth and \"replicants\" in Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? and its film adaptation Blade Runner).\nCarlo Collodi's Pinocchio \u2013 A puppet that comes to life.\nFeathertop \u2013 A scarecrow created and brought to life by a witch.\nFrankenstein's Monster from Frankenstein \u2013 A creation of Victor Frankenstein made from various body parts. Frankenstein's Monster was also adapted in DC Comics and Marvel Comics.\nThe Universal Pictures film Bride of Frankenstein featured the titular monster that was made by a collaboration of Henry Frankenstein and Doctor Septimus Pretorius.\nFritz Lang's Metropolis \u2013 Featuring \"Maria\" the robotrix.\nGalatea from Metamorphoses \u2013 A statue of a female created by Pygmalion and brought to life by Aphrodite.\nGargoyles \u2013 Statues sculpted to resemble monsters.\nHatsune Miku \u2013 A virtual idol VOCALOID known well among the otaku culture.\nHolograms \u2013 Computerized images of anything.\nHomunculus \u2013 Small miniature humanoids created through alchemy.\nKarel \u010capek's RUR \u2013 Originated the word robot.\nNeutrinos from Solaris \u2013 A race of creatures made from the memories of humans.\nNomu \u2013 Creatures from My Hero Academia. Also known as \"Artificial Humans\", the Nomu are deceased humans whose bodies were altered and modified by Dr. Kyudai Garaki to hold more than one Quirk. These mindless creations are used by the League of Villains and later its extended counterpart the Paranormal Liberation Front.\nPintosmalto \u2013 A statue of a man-made from large amounts of sugar and sweet almonds, scented water, musk and amber, various jewels, gold thread, and above all a trough and a silver trowel who was brought to life by a Goddess of Love.\nRealm of the Mad God has several enemies stated to be simulacrums in-universe. Most notably, the incarnation of Oryx the Mad God that the player fights in Oryx's Chamber is explicitly stated by Oryx to not be his real form. In addition, the versions of various bosses fought in the \"Mad God Mayhem\" dungeon are all stated to be simulacrums, and the version of Dr. Terrible fought in the Mad Lab is stated to be a simulacrum in additional media.\nRevenant \u2013 A robot with the mind of a former human hitman in the Apex Legends universe.\nRobots\nSimulacrum Soldier \u2013 Robotic soldiers with human minds employed by both the IMC and Frontier Militia in the Titanfall universe. While they bear a superficial resemblance to the commonly-fielded BRD-01 Spectre, Simulacra are instead human minds uploaded into robotic bodies. A simulacrum can be considered a form of transhumanism.\nSimulacrum Spell \u2013 An illusion spell from Dungeons & Dragons that creates a partially real duplicate of someone, though it only has half the power and abilities of the original.\nSnegurochka \u2013 A little girl made of snow.\nSquadron Supreme of America - In Marvel Comics, the Squadron Supreme of America are revealed to be simulacrums created by Mephisto and programmed by the Power Elite so that Phil Coulson can have them be a United States-sponsored superhero team.\nTerracotta Army \u2013 Terracotta sculptures of the armies of Qin Shi Huang.\nThe Gingerbread Man \u2013 A gingerbread man that came to life.\nThe Golem of Jewish folklore \u2013 A creation of a rabbi.\nThumbelina \u2013 A small girl created by a witch.\nUshabiti \u2013 Egyptian figurines.\nVasilisa the Beautiful \u2013 A doll that came to life.\nAlso, the illusions of absent loved ones created by an alien life form in Stanislaw Lem's Solaris can be considered simulacra.\n\nSee also[edit]\nMemetics\nSimulacra and Simulation\nSimulated reality\nReferences[edit]\n\n^ \"Word of the Day\". dictionary.com. 1 May 2003.
