                    "\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHELLO.\nHiya!\nHow are you?\nI\u2019m very good. I\u2019m in a coffee shop on [happening East London\u2019s] Curtain Road. You didn\u2019t fall asleep again did you?\nEDITOR\u2019S NOTE: Marina is referring to a phone interview mishap during the promotion of her first album when Popjustice fell asleep and was woken by the sound of Marina ringing for her phone interview. No questions had been written, chaos ensued, the interview didn\u2019t run.\nNo, there are some actual written-down questions this time.\nOh that\u2019s a relief, I can never tell if it\u2019s just a catch up chat or a real interview, so\u2026\nWell this is a bit of both. You\u2019re putting a new song online today, so hopefully you can explain what\u2019s going on.\nYes.\nSo what\u2019s going on? What\u2019s all this Electra Heart business? What\u2019s \u2018Fear & Loathing\u2019?\nWell, today I\u2019m releasing a song called \u2018Fear & Loathing\u2019. It\u2019s not a single, it\u2019s just an album track. And basically Electra Heart is a story. I don\u2019t even know if it\u2019s going to take the form of an album yet, but it\u2019s a really cinematic 70s Americana-type film and each part of the story comes in Part One, Part Two, Part Three. The song that\u2019s going online today is Part One. It\u2019s quite hard to explain because I think a lot of people will think Electra Heart is an alter ego or something but she\u2019s not, it\u2019s kind of basically a vehicle to portray part of the American dream, with elements of Greek tragedy and that\u2019s all going to be coming out through the visuals. It\u2019s hard to explain but I think you\u2019ll see it when it all comes together.\nOkay. So she\u2019s a kind of character through whom you\u2019re telling\u2026 Some stories about yourself? Or is it all about her?\nEr\u2026 Well yeah I suppose it\u2019s my view, as someone who\u2019s not American, of the American dream.\nRight.\nI\u2019m obsessed with it all. I just love the side of it that\u2019s really vapid and hollow. And that\u2019s kind of what I\u2019ve really explored. The whole album is around that.\nDo you think that level of vapidity and hol\u00adlow\u00adness is something that you just find in America? You say you\u2019re on Curtain Road now, you wouldn\u2019t have to go far to find something pretty vapid and hollow in East London\u2026\n(Guffaws) Well it\u2019s in all of us, isn\u2019t it? Everyone\u2019s vapid to a degree, just like not everyone is 100% pure and innocent or kind.\nEr, hello? Speak for yourself!\nOh HA HA HA \u2014 shut up! But everyone drifts through different char\u00adac\u00adters every single day, based on the context of the situation they\u2019re in.\nThis might sound a bit combative and it\u2019s not meant to but do you not feel that you made this point in \u2018Hollywood\u2019 on your last album?\nYes, but I was more cel\u00adeb\u00adrat\u00ading the kitsch, glamorous element whereas with this the imagery is totally different. It\u2019s still based on\u2026 Actually, have you seen the [UPCOMING TRACK WHOSE TITLE WE HAVE BEEN ASKED TO WITHHOLD FOR THE TIME BEING] video yet?\nNo.\nOkay, well that\u2019s like a really 70s thing, it\u2019s set in the desert\u2026 I just think every artist always has something at the core of them that fas\u00adcin\u00adates them and inspires them. In the beginning I had exactly the same thought \u2014 \u201coh God, I\u2019m still inspired by America, I don\u2019t want to make \u2018Hollywood Pt II\u2019\u201d. And it\u2019s not like that. I\u2019m just really inspired by that topic and that culture and I think I always will be. It\u2019s kind of like how every longterm artist always has a thread running through their image, or their lyrics, and that\u2019s mine. America.\nBut America\u2019s fifty states, there are so many different Americas\u2026 The Las Vegas subtext of \u2018Fear & Loathing\u2019 feels like a pretty easy target with the whole \u2018vapid\u2019 theme, and there are plenty of places in America that aren\u2019t vapid\u2026\nNo, there are, you\u2019re right. That\u2019s what I want to explore. I want to explore the side that has nothing to do with glamour, and that\u2019s all about loss and failure, and that\u2019s more apparent now with the American economy and stuff like that. But that image, that illusion we have of America really fas\u00adcin\u00adates me.\nYou\u2019ve spent a lot of time in America so it\u2019s been around you, but it feels funny that as a UK artist, and you\u2019re sitting in London now, well, there\u2019s a lot happening in the UK that\u2019s inspir\u00ada\u00adtional enough. Economy, riots, Cher Lloyd at Number One\u2026 These are turbulent times.\n(Laughs) I agree, it\u2019s shocking.\nI mean people are going to write amazing songs about what is happening right now. Actually let\u2019s be honest, lots of people are going to write fucking awful songs about what\u2019s happening right now, but\u2026\nWhat, about the looting?\nThere are just going to be a lot of people who decide that they\u2019re going to try and come up with their attempt at a \u2018Ghost Town\u2019 to capture the mood of the nation.\nProbably, but lyrically, well, I\u2019m not a political person. I def\u00adin\u00aditely draw inspir\u00ada\u00adtion socially and cul\u00adtur\u00adally, but I\u2019m not someone who\u2019s like \u2018I\u2019m for a revolu\u00adtion\u2019. It\u2019s more about fantasy.\nHow is the fantasy element present in your new project?\nWell for one it\u2019s painted as a modern day tragedy \u2014 that\u2019s quite fant\u00adast\u00adical. It\u2019s painted as a play, like a film. It\u2019s about living. It\u2019s just my nature, I\u2019m really overly dramatic.\nAnd these songs that are going to be appearing. There\u2019s one today, and then there\u2019s\u2026\nThe banger.\nYes the banger. So this album, or col\u00adlec\u00adtion of songs or whatever it is, they tell a story\u2026\nYes.\nSo are you releasing them in order, with each song as a chapter to tell that story?\nFor example with \u2018Fear & Loathing\u2019 [the video] I didn\u2019t want to just pop up going (cheesy voice) \u201cHEY!!!! I\u2019M BACK EVERYONE WEARING A WHITE BLONDE WIG, I\u2019M A POPSTAR!!!!\u201d. I wanted it to be artistic, and it\u2019s turned out that way. So \u2018Fear & Loathing\u2019 has turned out to be the trans\u00adition into the anti\u00adthesis. Like everything I\u2019m not, that\u2019s what I\u2019m becoming.\nHm\u2026\nThe whole idea, the whole notion of pop culture and espe\u00adcially pop music is ALL based on illusion. And por\u00adtray\u00ading yourself as something more exciting than you are. And my heart is always against that. So that\u2019s why I\u2019m doing it. I\u2019m SO against it that I almost have to play the part. Does that make sense to you?\nSort of, but\u2026 Are you not overthink\u00ading it a bit?\n(Laughs) People say that to me every day. Just generally! (Laughs)\nCan you explain again, in a short sentence, what\u2019s going on? To make it abso\u00adlutely clear.\nOkay. Electra Heart is the anti\u00adthesis of everything that I stand for. And the point of intro\u00addu\u00adcing her and building a whole concept around her is that she stands for the corrupt side of American ideology, and basically that\u2019s the cor\u00adrup\u00adtion of yourself. My worst fear \u2014 that\u2019s anyone\u2019s worst fear \u2014 is losing myself and becoming a vacuous person. And that happens a lot when you\u2019re very ambitious. Does that make sense a bit more?\nYes.\nAnd that\u2019s why it\u2019s imper\u00adat\u00adive that she\u2019s blonde. I wanted it to be really unnatural. Like, I\u2019ve rejected everything of myself.\nIs this not just you finding a way to distance yourself from something you\u2019ve made but you\u2019re not happy with?\n(Pause) Dunno! Isn\u2019t that what ALL music is about? (Laughs)\nBut not all popstars come along with their second album and go, \u2018do you know what, I don\u2019t like this so I\u2019m going to invent a character to subvert it and turn it in on itself\u2019. \nIf you pin it on an alter-ego or a character it becomes cliched and it really isn\u2019t that \u2014 I want it to be like a film, where you follow this character on a journey.\nSo the start of the journey that you see with the first \u2018Fear & Loathing\u2019 video\u2026 You see her cutting her hair. What does this symbolise?\nChange.\nOkay.\n(Roars with laughter) Sorry, you crack me up.\nWhat?\nNo, it\u2019s fine, carry on. So that rep\u00adres\u00adents change\u2026\nEr\u2026 Okay. But nothing more than that?\nNo, I suppose ques\u00adtion\u00ading who you are?\nBut the point is that most popstars come back with a new haircut when they release their new album. Like Example. He\u2019s got a popstar haircut now, but didn\u2019t have one before.\nYes.\nAnd popstars don\u2019t usually come back going, \u2018ooh, here\u2019s a video of me cutting my hair in black and white\u2019.\nAnd that\u2019s because they like to facil\u00adit\u00adate the illusion. But I\u2019m not inter\u00adested in main\u00adtain\u00ading that. I\u2019m inter\u00adested in decon\u00adstruct\u00ading it. Like with the [UPCOMING TRACK WHOSE TITLE WE HAVE BEEN ASKED TO WITHHOLD FOR THE TIME BEING] video it starts off and it\u2019s very kind of Mulholland Drive / Paris, Texas, that kind of vibe, and I\u2019m actually filming myself putting on the wig, but I don\u2019t care that it\u2019s \u2018ruining the illusion\u2019. That\u2019s the whole point \u2014 you\u2019re becoming something you\u2019re not.\nCan\u2019t you just do a nice pop song?\n(Laughs) (Stop laughing) (Laughs again) Am I meant to answer that?\nDo you need to make this so com\u00adplic\u00adated?\n(Pause)\nOr is it me that\u2019s making it too com\u00adplic\u00adated by asking too many questions?\nI think so. I think you\u2019ll under\u00adstand when you see the second video. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s com\u00adplic\u00adated at all, actually, but maybe that\u2019s because I\u2019ve heard the rest of the album. Think of your favourite artists who have very specific visions. If you\u2019d listened to just one of their songs then inter\u00adviewed them based on that one song, you might not have under\u00adstood the whole thing.\n\u2018Fear & Loathing\u2019 starts off with you singing in the first person, then by the chorus you\u2019re singing in the third person. Who\u2019s the \u2018I\u2019 and who\u2019s the \u2018you\u2019?\n(Laughs) Well I\u2019m always talking to myself, in every song, that I\u2019ll ever write, in my life. (Chortles at length) I like to say it\u2019s about rela\u00adtion\u00adships just to look a bit more normal, but it never is! (Laughs) No, but it\u2019s def\u00adin\u00aditely to myself.\nBut to clear this up \u2014 it\u2019s not you talking to Electra Heart or anything like that.\nNo. Electra in my head is not like this real person. I don\u2019t want it to be like a cringey alter-ego, because I don\u2019t feel that it is.\nSo is it more like Plan B and Strickland Banks?\nI don\u2019t know. I guess there are parts of it, just like with Strickland Banks\u2026 You could relate it to David Bowie I suppose. I think artists have a tendency to have different per\u00adson\u00adal\u00adit\u00adies, or maybe everyone does I don\u2019t know, but I think artists are maybe more vivid about how they artic\u00adu\u00adlate different parts of them\u00adselves. But even if you look at the first album, the way in which I wrote was very much in a storytelling manner. I think this is now a dis\u00adtil\u00adla\u00adtion of that, if you know what I mean.\nThat does make sense. You know the line in \u2018Fear & Loathing\u2019 about trying to have it all but ending up with not very much at all? Could you give an example of when that has happened?\nYes. I mean, you know my per\u00adson\u00adal\u00adity I think. It just seems like people who don\u2019t try in life, it kind of works for them. But because I wanted it so badly on my first album, and also because I\u2019m a bigmouth and I like to say ridicu\u00adlous things, when you don\u2019t meet your own expect\u00ada\u00adtions or you don\u2019t achieve the things you\u2019ve said you want to achieve, you feel like a failure. And quite frankly I still am in my head, because I know where I want to go.\nThe first album felt a bit like a second album. There was a self-con\u00adscious\u00adness to it. Or maybe a self-awareness to it, but there was a quality that you rarely get on a debut album. It\u2019s usually album two before people start respond\u00ading to the world\u2019s response to them. And the first album is usually unaware of the reality of what\u2019s to come. Like, you know how an element of self awareness is one of the things that separates us from the animals? It feels like debut albums have a more anim\u00adal\u00adistic feel, and you never had that. \nEr\u2026 Yeah.\nThat didn\u2019t make very much sense did it.\nI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a com\u00adpli\u00adment or not but I\u2019m going to go with \u2018not\u2019.\nIt wasn\u2019t meant as a criticism, but it just feels as if we have missed your innocent phase because even while you were recording your debut album you were straight into music industry hell.\nThere was no innocence! Actually, quite frankly, there WAS. Because I wrote, for example, \u2018Hollywood\u2019 a year and a half before I was signed. And it\u2019s funny actually because people will always try and pick holes in things like that. When it was a single \u2018bloggers\u2019 were going \u201coh she\u2019s sold out\u201d, and I was like, \u201cwhat are you going on about? I wrote that on a \u00a3200 keyboard two years ago\u201d. So I think I had an innocent phase but maybe I\u2019m just the sort of person who feels like people are watching.\nWell people ARE watching. \nYes. Good!\nThe idea of trying to have it all seems relevant to [UPCOMING TRACK WHOSE TITLE WE HAVE BEEN ASKED TO WITHHOLD FOR THE TIME BEING], because it\u2019s very much a Marina song in lots of ways but in other ways it sounds a lot like a 2011-era hit single. \nYes I think it does and it\u2019s not something I\u2019ve done before. If this was a year ago I don\u2019t mind saying now that I would have been, like, \u201cno way am I doing this\u201d. I was not even up for working with anyone. This is why these two songs fit really well together actually, because \u2018Fear & Loathing\u2019 is about genuinely not feeling bitter or crazy or jealous any more (nervous laugh) and actually feeling a lot better off for it. And so I\u2019ve been working with a lot of other people. I\u2019ve been working with Dr Luke, Stargate, and I\u2019ve learned SO much. And I\u2019ve done an album \u2014 well, it\u2019s nearly done \u2014 that\u2019s so exciting and feels like a real album. I just think, if I\u2019d sat in my bedroom and carried on as I was because I thought that equalled cred\u00adib\u00adil\u00adity, I don\u2019t think I would have produced a good album. With Stargate the pro\u00adduc\u00adtion is the anti\u00adthesis of everything I\u2019ve done so far, but I think you have to try [line breaks up]. And I really like the song now. I\u2019ve really grown into it!\nSo you didn\u2019t like it to start with?\nNo, I did\u2026 But we ori\u00adgin\u00adally composed it to this sort of guitar dance track. Then on the last night of working with them someone from Amsterdam sent in an instru\u00admental to a different girl that didn\u2019t work. And then Tor [from Stargate] was like, \u2018oh my God, what if we turn put it under\u00adneath that track\u2019, and I was like, \u2018hm\u2026\u2019, and then we did it and it sounded amazing. And I really wanted to go with it. This is like the only time I would have released that song, I think. End of the summer\u2026 Before I have an album out. It\u2019s not the sort of song that would be the lead single for an album.\nWhat do you think your fans are going to make of it?\nI think some people will hate it and some people are going to love it.\nSome of your moaning fans are going to go fucking mental!\nProbs! But writing to your fanbase is the worst thing you can do, so I\u2019m never going to do that.\n\nBut in terms of your vocals, and the melodies, and the lyrics, it\u2019s com\u00adpletely Marina. \nYes! Of course it is.\nBut it\u2019s not like you\u2019ve just gone in, idiot-style, and gone \u2018oh I\u2019ll just sing any old rubbish over a generic Dr Luke backing track\u2019.\n(Laughs) No. And also, my stuff gets remixed to oblivion, so I was like, why DON\u2019T I do a dance song? (Laughs) And ALSO, with \u2018Fear & Loathing\u2019 , the song\u00adwrit\u00ading structure is so up and down and all over the place that it\u2019s really nice to just write a nice stream\u00adlined song for a change.\nWell that\u2019s the good thing, it\u2019s just a love song\u2026\n(Laughs) It might sound like that but really I\u2019m just talking to myself, ha ha ha! No, not really.\nIs there anything else you\u2019d like to explain today?\nNo, I don\u2019t think so. Except \u2018Fear & Loathing Part Two\u2019 is coming next Monday.\nRight, and that\u2019s [UPCOMING TRACK WHOSE TITLE WE HAVE BEEN ASKED TO WITHHOLD FOR THE TIME BEING]?\nYes, with the video. It\u2019s going to be the two videos together that are going to be on iTunes, and [UPCOMING TRACK WHOSE TITLE WE HAVE BEEN ASKED TO WITHHOLD FOR THE TIME BEING] you can buy on September 26.\nYeah alright \u2018plugging\u2019, do you want to read out the iTunes URL while you\u2019re at it?\n(Guffaws) Okay. So I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything else. I don\u2019t know when Part Three will come. A while later. Maybe at the end of the year.\n So it\u2019s not leading into an album? How modern.\nNo. But it might be, you never know.\nWell this certainly clears things up, and in some ways makes them more com\u00adplic\u00adated.\nI wonder if this interview will get shelved like the last one?\nHopefully it\u2019ll go up this afternoon.\nWhat a bitch though, I was so upset that the last one was shelved. I thought it was my moment to shine. No \u2014 in the bin.\nDidn\u2019t it go up in the end?\nNo! Unless you put it on, like, shitweb.com.\n We should use shitweb.com as a repos\u00adit\u00adory for all our rubbish we don\u2019t use. Crap Popjustice inter\u00adviews and crap Marina demos. \nOH YES THAT\u2019S AMAZING. Okay, well, that\u2019s it.\n Nice to have you back. \nThanks!\n*\n\n You can keep track of Electra Heart here and Marina here. Right? Right. \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"
