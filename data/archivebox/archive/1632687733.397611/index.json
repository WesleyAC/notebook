                    "\n\nHow to apply for Taiwan's Employment Gold Card\n\n\nIn February 2018, Taiwan launched an \"Employment Gold Card\",a combination of residence visa and work permit. Aimed to attract more high level professionals, the card has strict application requirements. Here's some information on those and a step-by-step guide on how to apply (see also: official guide). \nDo I qualify?\nYou must have worked in one of the below eight fields, and met requirements within the field. This is a very brief unofficial summary not to be relied on - please refer to the supporting document for your field for the official information. Other than law and architecture you only need to meet one of the criteria, and most have a catch-all entry for \"other\" qualifications as approved by the relevant ministry. Salary references are monthly. This post was updated in October 2019 with to reflect relaxed qualifications in Sport and Culture.\n\n \n \n \n\n  Field\n  Requirements \n  Supporting Documents\n \n\n  Science and Technology\n  \nSalary over TWD 160k\nOutstanding talent or innovation performance in a cutting edge field (see list); alternately distinctive or uncommon ability\nReceived a major international award\nA publishing academic at Associate level or above\nPhD holder for >4 years, or in a special field\n\n\n   Foreign specialist personnel with special expertise in science & technology\n \n\n  Economics\n  \nSalary over TWD 160k\nExecutive of an R&D centre, HQ or Taiwan branch office\nInternational award recipient or has more than 4 years of experience\n\u00a0More than 8 years of work experience in key fields (see list)\n\n\n  Foreign special professionals with specialized knowledge/skills in economic fields\n \n\n  Education\n  \nSalary over TWD 160k \nPhD from top 200 university\nMore than 5 years of teaching, and recently worked at a top 500 university\nWon a Yushan Scholar award\n\n\n  Foreign Special Professionals Possessing Special Expertise in the Field of Education\n \n\n  Culture and Art\n  \nImportant person in an international organisation or government\nOrganiser of a significant event\nReceived or judged an important award or competiton\nEditor of a major publication\nProfessor of communications\nRecognised as a preserver of ancient techniques\nSpecial contribution to film, broadcast or pop music with more than 5 years experience\n\n\n  Foreign Special Professional Who Possesses Special Expertise in the Field of Culture and Arts\n\nDocuments Required for Foreign Professionals Engaging in Arts and Performing Arts\n \n\n  Sport\n  \nTop 3 in an international competition, or first place in the Asian Games or World Championships\nA national team coach, or a coach who has coached athletes to the level in the previous bullet \nServed as a referee at the Asian or Olypic Games \n\n\n  Foreign Special Professionals Possessing Special Expertise in the Field of Sport \n \n\n  Finance\n  \nSalary over TWD 160k\nPractising CFA,CFP, FRM, CIIA, CIA, PRM, FSA, FCAS, FIA, FIAA, SEI-KAIIN\nExecutive of a financial institution\nMore than 5 years in financial position\n\n\n  Requirements and determination principles for\u201cForeign special professional\u201d with financial expertise\n \n\n  Law\n  \nMust have a salary over TWD 160k\nMust have obtained ROC foreign legal affairs attorney license\nMust hold or have held a research position outside Taiwan\n\u00a0Must hold a law related executive position\nMust be recommended by the Taiwan Bar Association\n\n\n    Foreign Special Professional Who Possesses Special Expertise in the Field of Law \n \n\n  Architecture\n  \nMust have a salary over TWD 160k\nMust have 5 years of experience or a license\n\n\n  Foreign Special Professional Who Possesses Special Expertise in the Field of Architecture\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\nWho can I talk to about this?\nYou're in for some serious luck here! The Gold Card comes with some direct contacts who are high level and exceptionally helpful. However, first it is critical to understand that this program is a collaboration of disparate Government departments who aren't necessarily in constant communication with each other. You will need to choose a department to contact depending on the stage of your application.\n\n\nThe master list of contacts is found here.\n\nIf you'd like to discuss:\n\u00a0whether you should apply eg benefits of the program, vague/early questions\n\nRead the Foreign Talent Act website \nAsk Contact Taiwan,\n particularly look out for their events with invited speakers from NIA. \nThey are a Government-funded organisation whose mission is to help you \nfind a job. They'll direct you to the right place\n\nthe online application portal, eg errors, ambiguous fields\n\nContact NIA, under the Ministry of Interior for Employment Gold Card Permits for Foreign Special Professionals on the master list\n\nskill qualification, eg required documents, why your initial set of documents was rejected\n\nContact the appropriate ministry under Qualification of Foreign Special Professionals on the master list\n\nstatus of your application eg where it is now, why it's taking so long\n\nThere is no specific department. In this case, most likely you will see the status as \"Professional Review by Workforce Development Agency\".\nFirst, try the WDA, under the Ministry of Labor for Employment Gold Card Permits for Foreign Special Professionals on the master list\nThey will probably tell you that the application is with the relevant ministry for your skill set and provide contact details\nIf not, try to contact the appropriate ministry under Qualification of Foreign Special Professionals on the master list\n\nvisas for your spouse/family\n\nContact NIA, under the Ministry of Interior for Employment \nGold Card Permits for Foreign Special Professionals on the master list\n\nincome tax reduction eg whether you qualify, how it works\n\nThe NIA can sometimes provide some basic information about this, otherwise contact the Ministry of Finance under Reduction or Exemption of Income Tax of Foreign Special Professionals on the master list\n\nA particular agency's implementation of the program eg make an appeal or complaint, talk to \"whoever's in charge\"\n\nContact the National Development Council.\n\n\n\nHow to apply?\nFirst, gather the required documents:\ndigital copy of your passport\ndigital copy of your passport photo\nlocate your previous Taiwanese visa and residence permit (if any)\ndates of any times you worked in Taiwan\ndigital copies of all documents needed to support your application\n\nNote: all digital copies need to be <500kb in size and of image format. You may need to use an image resizing tool.\n\nThen, visit the difficult-to-find address: \n\n\u00a0https://coa.immigration.gov.tw/coa-frontend/four-in-one/entry/golden-card\n\nand click \"I want to apply\". Select \"self application\", click consent and create an account.\n\nTo make a new application, click Application-->Application for Employment Gold Card --> New Application.\n\nStep through each of the sections, making sure you fill out each section before the ~5 minute timeout logs you out. Click save on each page to see if there are any errors detected.\n\nNote: the length of time you select for the card (eg 3 years) will determine its cost.\n\nEventually, view the preview and then hit submit!\n\nNote: you will receive an email at this point telling you to pay. If you didn't get it, check your email address was correct.\n\nYou must then go through the payment steps in order for your application to be considered.\n\nNote: you will receive an email at this point telling you to get your receipt. Follow the steps to download it, and print it out - you will need it to collect your card.\nPost-application steps.\n\nYour qualifications will be assessed.\n\nFirst, the Ministry of Labor will attempt to sign off on the work permit. If it can do this itself (eg you apply based on the salary criteria and provide the right documents), your application will be swift (one case took just two days).\nIf the Ministry of Labor can't vet your skills, it will call in the appropriate Ministry (eg \"Science and Technology) to assist. That Ministry will then create a custom panel of judges who are skilled in your area of application. This takes some time, and if you are skilled in a niche area expect the application to take longer than 30 days at this stage.\n\nYour identity will be verified\n\nIf you are overseas, you will visit the nearest Taiwanese diplomatic post\nIf you are in Taiwan, you will visit the Bureau of Consular Affairs \n\nA final review is conducted by the Ministry of Interior\nYour Gold Card will be issued.\n\nClaim it in Taiwan at the National Immigration Agency\nClaim it at your nearest diplomatic post\n\n\n\nWhat to do when you are asked to provide additional documents\nAfter a few weeks of tense wait, you may receive an email from niasys@immigration.gov.tw that says \"After the examination by the department and the enterprise competent authority, the relevant information shall be made up.\".\n\nLog in to the portal at:\nhttps://coa.immigration.gov.tw/coa-frontend/four-in-one/entry/golden-card\n\nYour application will be listed under \"Application cases of which data to be supplemented\", click View.\n\nUp the top of the application will be a block of red text in Chinese and English. It will attempt to explain what additional documents are required. If it doesn't make sense, call the appropriate ministry contact under Qualification of Foreign Special Professionals on the master list. They'll be able to look up your application and provide more colour.\n\n\nOnce you know which documents to upload, prepare to upload them as with your previous application. Additionally, prepare a short statement in Chinese addressing how you have rectified the \"Opinion on the Application\". Select the documents for upload and paste the Chinese in the \"Reply Comments\" box at the bottom of the final page.\n\nImportant: Don't use English in the \"Reply Comments\" box, it will cause your application to fail to be submitted with a cryptic error."
