                    "Almost half a billion dollars\u00a0could be coming to the Waste Isolation Pilot as\u00a0federal legislation advanced to the floor of the U.S. Senate, led by U.S. Sen. Tom Udall (D-NM) and intended to fund operations at U.S. Department of Energy sites and projects across the country.Udall serves as senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, which unanimously supported moving the bill to the Senate floor for a full vote.The legislation provided federal funds for New Mexico\u2019s national labs, environmental clean-up projects and tribal energy programs throughout the U.S., along with about $403 million for recovery operations and ongoing work at WIPP \u2013 an underground repository for transuranic (TRU) waste near Carlsbad.Support local journalism. Subscribe to the Carlsbad Current-Argus.\u00a0\u201cThis funding will help bolster New Mexico\u2019s thriving science and technology economy \u2013 while providing the resources needed to ensure environmental clean-up and public safety,\u201d Udall said.\u201cThis bill invests in New Mexico\u2019s state of the art national labs and the men and women doing cutting-edge work at them, and it supports the tech transfer initiatives that energize and diversify our economy.\u201dHe also pointed to investments the bill would make in\u00a0water projects throughout New Mexico, the day after New Mexico. Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham announced a consortium and memorandum of understanding between New Mexico State University and the New Mexico Environment Department to study how produced waste water from oil and gas operations could be treated and reused.More:WIPP: Federal board raises concerns for air system; cites poor monitoring, slow response\u201cThe bill also invests in New Mexico\u2019s most precious resource \u2013 water \u2013 to ensure a more sustainable future for our state,\u201d Udall.\u00a0 \u201cAs the appropriations process moves forward, I will continue standing up for New Mexico and the first-rate technology that is being developed in our state.\u201dDuring a discussion on the bill ahead of the Committee\u2019s approval, Udall voiced concerns about funding included for a \u201cpilot program\u201d to allow the DOE to fund facilities to temporarily store commercial spent nuclear fuel ahead of a the development of a permanent repository.One such facility, proposed by Holtec International, could be built near Carlsbad and Hobbs, intending to hold up to 120,000 metric tons of spent nuclear fuel rods on the surface in a consolidated interim storage facility (CIS).More:WIPP: The U.S. Department of Energy's 4 goals for the next five yearsAnother in Andrews, Texas proposed by Waste Control Specialists would augment an existing facility for low-level nuclear waste to hold about 40,000 metric tons of high-level waste.Without a permanent repository in development, Udall cautioned such projects could become permanent despite their designs as temporary facilities.\u201cFor many years, the chair and ranking member have used this bill to carry authorizing language that sets up a \u2018pilot program\u2019 for interim storage program for nuclear waste before a final repository is established,\u201d Udall said.\u201cWe have had debates and even votes on this and other matters dealing with how to handle commercial nuclear fuel that is stranded at power plants. I appreciate the chair and ranking member\u2019s earnest desire to resolve this issue, but I continue to have very serious reservations with their approach.\u201dMore:WIPP: Shipments, mining continue amid facility upgradesSenate Appropriations Committee Chairman Richard Shelby (R-Ala.) said the bill was essential work towards essential projects throughout the U.S.\u00a0\u201cThis legislation supports a host of important national priorities, such as science and research, nuclear security, and critical infrastructure projects across the country,\" he said.\u00a0\"By advancing this measure through the process today, we are taking a significant step toward funding the government and strengthening our nation.\u201dMore:Allies clap back at Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham's resistance to nuclear site near CarlsbadHow does the bill benefit New Mexico?The about $49 billion in funding contained in the bill funded numerous nuclear and water projects in New Mexico.Here are the biggest projects included for the Land of Enchantment.Waste Isolation Pilot Plant: $403 million was appropriated to support ongoing operations, along with recovery efforts for an accident radiological release in 2014 that led to a three-year cease in the facilities mining and waste emplacement activities.Los Alamos National Laboratory: About $220 million for environmental clean up at the lab, and to remove radioactive and toxic waste.Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board: The bill provides $31 million for safety oversight work conducted by the board, and includes language to strengthen its oversight missionMore:Environmentalist groups appeal federal licensing of nuclear waste facility near CarlsbadTribal energy programs: About $25 million was provided to support energy development on tribal lands, supporting a loan guarantee program to support developing commercial renewable energy projects.Bureau of Reclamation: The Bureau got a funding increase of $191 million, up to about $1.6 billion for Fiscal Year 2020, for numerous projects in New Mexico.WaterSmart, a water conservation program focused on water projects throughout the state including\u00a0Rio Charma restoration and climate change studies in the Rio Grande Basinm, got a funding increase of about $60 million.\u00a0The Bureau also got funding for Water infrastructure projects in:Navajo- Gallup: $66.1 millionAamodt Settlement: $8.3 millionRio Grande Pueblos: $68,000Middle Rio Grande Project: $22.6 millionCarlsbad Project: $3.5 millionMore:Waste to water: From basin to basin, oil and gas water dilemma grows as production boomsAdrian Hedden can be reached at 575-628-5516, achedden@currentargus.com or @AdrianHedden on Twitter."
