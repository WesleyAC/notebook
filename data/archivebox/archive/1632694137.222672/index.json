When I had CDs, for example, I could loan out a CD to my friend and that was legal, but I wasn\u2019t allowed to make a copy of that CD and loan the copies out.  Apparently I only purchased a license to listen to it myself, but what if that CD got scratched, lost, or broken?  I bought the license to listen to it, right?  So therefore if it got scratched, I should be able to download it and listen to it because I still have the license, right?  Yeah, no, that\u2019s illegal.  Or, let\u2019s say I go into iTunes and buy a song in digital form, like an MP3.  Do I have the right to let my friends borrow it just like I did with CDs?  I think if they actually take my ability away to play that MP3 then it is legal, so if I give them a hard drive or that\u2019s the only copy of the MP3 I have and it\u2019s on there, then that\u2019s okay, but no, no, no, there\u2019s no way I\u2019m loaning my only MP3 out to my friend on a hard drive.\n\nI learned my lesson from that scratched CD; I\u2019m backing up all my music in multiple places so that I don\u2019t lose it.  So, if I loan out an MP3, I\u2019m only gonna loan out a copy of that which now means I\u2019m making copies and giving them out.  Or what if I\u2019m just totally done with the songs I\u2019ve downloaded and paid for, like MP3s I bought from iTunes or Amazon?  Can I resell those?  Like, is there a used MP3 marketplace somewhere?  No, a judge has ruled that\u2019s illegal, too.  So, it looks like the music industry has really failed to adapt to the digital age when it comes to copyright and they have faced many fierce opponents in this battle.  One of their biggest rivals has been The Pirate Bay and this battle fascinates me, so let\u2019s get into it.  Oh, and in this episode there are a few swear words, so expect them to jump out here and there.  If you\u2019d rather not listen to bad language, well, you\u2019ve been warned.\n\n(INTRO):\t[INTRO MUSIC] These are true stories from the dark side of the internet.  I\u2019m Jack Rhysider.  This is Darknet Diaries.  [INTRO MUSIC ENDS]\n\nSINGER:\t[MUSIC] Oh, I come from the days of The Pirate Bay when we would torrent and leech all day.  The MP3s and MKVs but I always kept clear of the .exes.  Soon, may the ISP come to bring us news of copyright scum.  One day, when downloading is done, we\u2019ll take our leave and go.\n\nJACK:\tSo, who started this thing?\n\nPETER:\tNot really sure.\n\nJACK:\tOkay.\n\nPETER:\tThat\u2019s a simple answer.  We were this group of people and we were in an IRC channel.  There were hackers, there were philosophers, there were engineers, everything you can imagine.  We didn\u2019t agree on things; we just agreed on internet is interesting, it\u2019s fun, and we can\u2019t let companies decide what\u2019s gonna go on.  So, we don\u2019t really know who started The Pirate Bay.  It was kind of a group effort.  We don\u2019t really know who came up with this topic to even discuss.  We don\u2019t remember who made the logo.\n\nJACK:\tIn this story we\u2019re talking about The Pirate Bay, the largest file torrenting index probably ever.  Basically, it\u2019s a search engine which you could type in the name of any song or movie and it would help you find a pirated version of that and connect you with the people who have it, so you can download it from them if you want.  This is Peter, one of the co-founders of The Pirate Bay.\n\nPETER:\tSo, I\u2019m Peter Sunde Kolmisoppi and in 2000 \u2013 early 2000s, I was part of starting The Pirate Bay which is a somewhat-known file-sharing service.\n\nJACK:\tYeah, while it\u2019s not really clear who started it, it eventually got picked up by three people in Sweden to run the site; Gottfrid, Fredrik, and Peter.\n\nPETER:\tAs a group, we were really \u2013 I think we were really bizarre because we are on three different political spectrums.  We could not be in the same room together.  We would start fighting but we all agreed on the value of the internet and freedom of information and kind of the equal access to information.  So, kind of whatever your view is, if you\u2019re left wing, if you\u2019re right wing, ultra libertarian, whatever you want to call yourself, we all need a basis where we can \u2013 that we can agree upon which would be access to information.  Otherwise, you can\u2019t make educated decisions and I think that\u2019s where we kind of \u2013 we agreed on that and nothing else and I think that\u2019s also very powerful that we didn\u2019t agree on [00:05:00] anything else, because we didn\u2019t bring those topics up because they would just ruin the thing we were working on.  So, we focused very much on one thing.  Otherwise, we started fighting.\n\nJACK:\tWell, besides wanting things to be freely available on the internet, they also all three shared a burning love for technology.  They loved computers, networking, websites, programming, system administration, the internet, and Linux, and they were good at what they did.  They were able to build a pretty stable high-traffic website running on minimal equipment with not many resources and just doing their best to keep it going under the heavy load.\n\nPETER:\tYeah, yeah, okay, okay, so we had some things more in common.\n\nJACK:\tOkay, so what exactly is The Pirate Bay?  Well, it\u2019s an index of BitTorrent files, and BitTorrent is a peer-to-peer file-sharing technology.  So, if you want to send a file to someone else online, one way to do that is through BitTorrent which is quite amazing because it lets you download from multiple places at once and as soon as you start getting some of it downloaded, you start sharing what you\u2019ve downloaded with others so they can download it, too.  BitTorrent is more robust and typically faster than downloading from one central location.  Now, using BitTorrent is perfectly fine and legal.  Most Linux installation discs are free and the team that makes that Linux distribution will often just add it to BitTorrent as a way to download it, and I think it\u2019s actually the preferred way that they recommend you download it, because it won\u2019t bog down their systems.\n\nBut when this protocol came out, people were like oh, hey, let\u2019s use this to share and trade pirated stuff like copies of movies, music, books, and games.  That worked wonderfully.  People were sharing music and movies and giving them away for free, and then those people would immediately share it so others could download it, and it just became a big file-sharing party.  But the problem is, how do you find movies and music that you want to download?  Well, that\u2019s where The Pirate Bay came in.  Pirate Bay by itself is a blank page, but users would submit torrent files which were just locations of where you could download the music or movies, and so The Pirate Bay became a sort of search engine to find pirated content.  It didn\u2019t host any of this content itself; it really was just like a search engine.\n\nPETER:\tThe core basis of Pirate Bay was that here\u2019s a platform.  It\u2019s good technology.  You can upload whatever as long as you\u2019re correct in your descriptions.  You could upload a virus, you could upload basically whatever.  If you say it\u2019s a virus, then it\u2019s fine.  If it\u2019s not a virus, we\u2019re gonna take it down if you\u2019re lying about it.  The good thing was that it\u2019s more of a freedom project than it is a technology project in many ways.  So, if you want to use it for your home videos, if you want to use it for your Linux distributions, if you want to use it for Hollywood movies, everything goes.  Everything\u2019s fine.  It\u2019s up to you.  It\u2019s just a tool.\n\nJACK:\tIt started in Sweden and it was just hosting Swedish content at first.\n\nPETER:\tIt became kind of a famous site in Sweden, then in the rest of Scandinavia, and then it kind of just grew.  [MUSIC] But because of the technology, it was \u2013 we added a server every year.  It wasn\u2019t much more than that.  I remember a few things that happened.  There was a big torrent site in Spain that got shut down, and Pirate Bay was all in Swedish but all of a sudden it was just filled with Spanish content like Spanish movies, Spanish books, Spanish music.  We didn\u2019t really understand what was going on until we realized there was some news about a really big torrent site in Spanish going down.  So, they just defaulted to moving over to Pirate Bay which was the only one that they could find on search engines, I guess.\n\nThe most downloaded torrent at that time on Pirate Bay was actually a Swedish language course and I found it really funny because they were trying to learn Swedish so they could use Pirate Bay because there was this desperation for something.  I think we realized that it was kind of an important project at that time.  Then we also had this idea that we wanted to play with the concept of Pirate Bay and not follow traditional standards, so we actually sent in a letter to the Swedish king saying look, we\u2019re promoting your language; maybe give us medal.  That was just like, this is \u2013 maybe it\u2019s illegal, maybe it doesn\u2019t really matter, but so many people in Spain are now trying to learn Swedish because of us, so you should just gratulate us and give us a medal.  People got really, really pissed at us for being annoying and at the same time right, and I just loved that whole vibe that we got with Pirate Bay.\n\nJACK:\tAfter a few years, Pirate Bay was the largest pirate search engine on the internet, with millions of users, and they didn\u2019t really care what was on their search engine which meant tons of people were sharing pirated software on The Pirate Bay.  Music, movies, games, books, apps, docs, whatever can be [00:10:00] shared digitally could be listed on The Pirate Bay.  Okay, so the powers that be think that this is piracy which goes against some laws.  What\u2019s your justification that this is not illegal?\n\nPETER:\tBut I don\u2019t really care if it\u2019s illegal or not.  That\u2019s kind of the core, again.  Someone has defined what is legal and what\u2019s illegal, and I don\u2019t really agree with that perspective.  For me, it\u2019s more important what\u2019s moral and what\u2019s immoral.  For me, it\u2019s immoral to actually say that you can\u2019t have this, you can\u2019t be part of the cultural conversation because you don\u2019t have enough money.  So for me, that was the justification of everything I did, is because I want access to information.  I want everyone to have the same access of information that I had growing up because I think it\u2019s a way to actually educate people and be part of a global conversation.  So, the law should \u2013 if there is a law against this, which there isn\u2019t in every country \u2013 but those laws are unjust, so I don\u2019t \u2013 I think it\u2019s fine to break a law that\u2019s not correct.\n\nJACK:\tHm, that actually sounds pretty compelling.  Like, for instance, Spotify lets you listen to millions of songs free, right?  But actually, Spotify only works in certain countries in the world and up until February 2021, there were only five countries in Africa that could get Spotify.  So, there\u2019s tons of people in Africa who can\u2019t afford to buy music and movies, and they can\u2019t stream it either, and no, you can\u2019t use iHeart or Pandora there either.  Both of those are legal in mostly English-speaking countries.  So, just by sheer luck, if you happen to be born in one of the countries that doesn\u2019t have Spotify, Pandora, or iHeartRadio, how are you going to enjoy the millions of songs that have had such an impact on our lives and shaped us to become who we are?\n\nA lot of people in Africa can\u2019t afford food, much less to buy music, and there\u2019s this copyright system set up not even in their country that restricts them from getting a copy online at a place like The Pirate Bay.  But you might ask what about the people who create the content?  Shouldn\u2019t they be paid fairly for the stuff they\u2019ve worked so hard on?  Yeah, sure, absolutely.  Nobody\u2019s saying they shouldn\u2019t, but what The Pirate Bay does is it challenges whether or not the current copyright system is the best way for artists to make money, because even though The Pirate Bay had millions of users downloading music illegally, the music industry was still smashing records.  Taylor Swift, Lady Gaga, Kanye West, and Adele were selling massive amounts of their albums during the height of piracy where you could just get it for free online.\n\nPETER:\tWe are copies of other things and the opposition, the anti-copyright \u2013 the copyright people and the anti-pirate people, they\u2019re kind of against us as human beings in many ways.\n\nJACK:\tWhoa, that\u2019s getting a little bit too far out there for me.  I mean, I guess it\u2019s true, but what?  Now, I want to say again that The Pirate Bay doesn\u2019t store any music or movies on their service.  It\u2019s just a search engine to connect you to the place that does have it, which in my opinion makes it very similar to what Google is.  The thing is, with the right skills, you can find all this same stuff on Google.  You can do things like type in the name of a song and then type in title:indexof and mp3, and essentially you\u2019re telling Google you want to search the contents of a directory to find music files.  So, you could easily point at Google and say they\u2019re also contributing to the piracy problem.\n\nPETER:\tWell, I think Google \u2013 if you look at piracy, Google is doing it for money and they\u2019re actually having copies of the data on their servers, so they\u2019re definitely much worse than Pirate Bay has ever been, \u2018cause with Pirate Bay you never had a copy on the server.  You \u2013 and you didn\u2019t \u2013 there was no way of making money from that, so Google are definitely commercially a pirate entity.\n\nJACK:\tNot only that, but you can easily find copyrighted music and videos all over YouTube.  I don\u2019t know how that\u2019s legal, but I\u2019m always surprised to see people uploading full movies or songs that are obviously copyrighted that just stay up for years and have hundreds of thousands of downloads.\n\nPETER:\tThe difference between Pirate Bay and Google is that they\u2019re considered good guys because they\u2019re business people, so I think that \u2013 I\u2019d say the opposition to Pirate Bay, they would also be business people that are interested in doing business with other businesses.  They\u2019re not interested in talking to some asshole people from Sweden challenging their existence, because I was very clear and I think my friends were very clear that we don\u2019t see a place for these copyright holders in the world that we\u2019re trying to build, so they\u2019re not the enemy; [MUSIC] they\u2019re just like, not worthwhile at all, so we didn\u2019t have them as enemies.  We just had them as someone to not care about whatsoever and that\u2019s dangerous for, I think, the business people when someone says you should not be even \u2013 even be part of the discussion.\n\nJACK:\tAh yes, of course; [00:15:00] business.  The music and film industry are big businesses and when you buy an album, it\u2019s the music industry that takes most of the money, leaving the artists with pennies on each sale.  While the media industries were trying to contact the people at The Pirate Bay to get them to take this content off, The Pirate Bay just didn\u2019t even bother to respond.  They had no interest in dealing with the film or music industry at all.\n\nPETER:\tSomeone has framed the discussion around something and we just take that framing for granted, and that\u2019s \u2013 I think that\u2019s the big thing we did with Pirate Bay, is that we did not allow our opposition\u2019s framing to be the frame that we accepted.  So, we made our own frame.  We framed the copyright discourse about freedom rather than money, and I think a lot of people enjoyed Pirate Bay because of the attitude and because of \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t say revolutionary but this alternative world that is available when you have free access to information.\n\nJACK:\tHow were you making money in those days?  Or, yeah, I\u2019m also curious if this was enough to make it your full-time job as well.\n\nPETER:\tNone of us worked on this full-time.  So, Fredrik and Gottfrid, they had a hosting company called PRQ, so they were working on that.  I worked at a small company myself and I worked for different clients.  Pirate Bay was just costing money, so there were advertising on Pirate Bay but the people that put up ads on Pirate Bay, they were like ringtones or some weird shit that was kind of semi-legal to sell whatsoever, and they didn\u2019t really pay much or anything at all.\n\nJACK:\tThe ads they placed on the site would offset the cost of running The Pirate Bay, but it doesn\u2019t look like the team made much money from this.  It actually seems like they were operating at a loss, like the whole time.\n\nPETER:\tBasically, in 2005 I think, 2004, 2005, we rebuilt Pirate Bay.  It was a one-week task, and then we never really looked at Pirate Bay \u2013 we never did anything with Pirate Bay in a technical way after that.  There was never any new features, there was never any new code, so since 2004, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s been any new code whatsoever.  Maybe now in the latest years.  I haven\u2019t followed the past two years much, but\u2026\n\nJACK:\tYeah, it looks the same even today.\n\nPETER:\tYeah, it looks \u2013 it always looked like shit and it always worked like crap.\n\nJACK:\tI totally agree, actually.  The Pirate Bay has always frustrated me.  First, it\u2019s always been very slow.  Second, the interface is hard to navigate sometimes to find a good torrent you\u2019re trying to download, and I\u2019ve thought about complaining to them many times.\n\nPETER:\tA lot of people were complaining about a lot of things and we always had the same answer and it\u2019s like first of all, we don\u2019t care.  [MUSIC] It works good enough.  We have other things to work on like day jobs that actually pay the bills so we can have a place to stay and have food, and then if you don\u2019t like it, then build your own.  Because it was also very important for us to not become a centralized hub and the irony is \u2013 because everyone else shut down because of legal threats \u2013 we became the only go-to place.  The Pirate Bay was just the only place left.  It was never the best file-sharing system.  It was never the best search engine.  It was quite crap, but we wanted people to be really annoyed about this and make something better so we didn\u2019t have to be the only alternative.\n\nSo instead of it being like Facebook and all of these other social media giants that are improving their technology all the time, it\u2019s like, it\u2019s good enough.  Someone will have to make something better because there\u2019s a lot of things that could be improved.  So, we spent really little time on technology.  The only thing we did was to move when we couldn\u2019t pay the bills.  So, that was basically \u2013 then we copied it, then put it somewhere else.  So, no one worked on the technology.  Of course, there was no support or anything else.  There was nothing, so our time that we spent on Pirate Bay was basically talking to media or talking to people about where to host next and so on.\n\nJACK:\tWhere to host next; see, that became the constant question because the powers that be were trying to close in on The Pirate Bay and get it shut down.  Do you agree that your site has been the most attacked by takedowns and just attacks in general than any other site out there?\n\nPETER:\tDefinitely.  I think that\u2019s \u2013 we\u2019ve been very much after that, I think, as well.  We\u2019ve been kind of \u2013 not hunting problems but we have not ever done something in a sane way when it comes to how to reply to legal threats or anything.  We just \u2013 have you seen Monty Python\u2019s \u2013 this movie about the knights who say Ni?\n\nJACK:\tYeah.\n\nPETER:\tSo you have this guy; [00:20:00] he\u2019s in a fight.  Someone cuts off his leg and he\u2019s like come on, come at me.  He doesn\u2019t back off.  He loses his arms, he loses everything.  It\u2019s just the head left and he\u2019s still like, so come attack me, you know?  I think Pirate Bay\u2019s exactly the same.  We didn\u2019t have this normal survival skill and people got really annoyed and just attacked more and more and more.  I think that since we had this idea that we were going to survive because of some higher values than just money or whatever, we\u2019re still around and most other people would have shut down a long time ago.  But you get to a point where it\u2019s like you\u2019re already so fucked that you can\u2019t be more fucked, so it doesn\u2019t really matter if you fuck someone else, you know?  If you\u2019re sued in one country and you\u2019re gonna lose all of the money you never had to begin with, it doesn\u2019t matter if you get sued in ten more countries and lose exactly the same amount which is zero in the end, right?  So, it\u2019s more a way of giving payback to asshole people that are against your project.\n\nJACK:\tHere we\u2019ve come to the part of the story that I\u2019m completely dumbfounded by.  I mean, still, after researching all this and learning as much as I can, I still can\u2019t figure out why this site is still operational.  I mean, if you have the world\u2019s largest pirating site on the internet, surely that won\u2019t last long, right?  Well, here we are in the year 2021 and The Pirate Bay is still going strong.  So, for the rest of this episode, I want to hear about all the ways people have tried to stop The Pirate Bay, and this is a long road, so buckle up and get comfy.\n\nPETER:\t[MUSIC] The first big takedown we had with Pirate Bay when it was \u2013 because of cops coming to actually take machines.  They were not after Pirate Bay; they were after another customer that the PRQ was hosting which was Kavkaz Center, which \u2013 it\u2019s a Chechen rebel movement that Putin was very upset about, so he ordered basically the Swedish cops to make a raid against PRQ.  Accidentally, it took down The Pirate Bay as well.\n\nJACK:\tThe Pirate Bay was hosted at a Swedish company called PRQ which actually was Gottfrid\u2019s company, one of the other co-founders of The Pirate Bay.  PRQ had sort of a reputation for hosting questionable stuff, and so the cops came and took a bunch of servers from PRQ trying to take one of their customers offline.\n\nPETER:\tThat was the first time we got raided; was not because of Pirate Bay.  It was because of Putin being upset with PRQ hosting a customer which was a Chechen rebel movement.\n\nJACK:\tOkay, we\u2019re off to a good start, right?  Vladimir Putin was behind their first real takedown.  The cops took Pirate Bay\u2019s servers but they just got some more and rebuilt the site.  It took them only a few days to get it back.  Now, for some reason, PRQ couldn\u2019t get enough bandwidth to run The Pirate Bay properly, so they had to move The Pirate Bay to another data center.\n\nPETER:\t[MUSIC] So, we had moved Pirate Bay into actually a banking data center because \u2013 it was also kind of a funny thing because a lot of people thought that we were hiding Pirate Bay.  We were there totally plain sight.  We had a picture of the servers in the rack with a GPS coordinates and a map of where they were actually hosted.\n\nJACK:\tAt this point, they knew people wanted to take them down and they\u2019d probably get raided by the cops again, so you would think if you know you\u2019re gonna get raided by the cops, you want to probably hide where you\u2019re hosting your servers, right?  Yeah, no, not these guys.  They put exactly where The Pirate Bay was hosted clearly and visible on their website, the exact latitude and longitude coordinates.  Why?  Because it was hosted in a place that they didn\u2019t think was touchable by the Swedish police.\n\nPETER:\tIt was very much a fuck you because we knew that what we were doing was legal, and then we placed it in a banking data center because it was protected.  It\u2019s a protected facility in Sweden, so the police are not actually allowed to go in.  It\u2019s only the military.  The whole idea was that it would fuck with the police because they\u2019re now allowed.  They don\u2019t have jurisdiction when it comes to banking.  That\u2019s the military basically, in Sweden, so they were not allowed to go in and actually raid it.\n\nJACK:\tThey were getting more takedown notices and cease and desist letters, but they just kept ignoring them.\n\nPETER:\tSo, what happened is that the Swedish movie and music companies, they were really, really upset with Pirate Bay, so they went to the cops all the time.  It\u2019s like, here\u2019s our movie that you can download and so on, and the prosecutors were looking into this quite a lot and trying to find ways to take it down because they knew there was a lot of pressure.  These are influential people.  They always came to the same conclusion that we\u2019re just a carrier, like an index, like the phone book, whatever.  So, it was totally legal.  We have this in black and white that The Pirate Bay is legal according to Swedish law.  So, the lobby groups, the anti-pirates, they kind of \u2013 in Hollywood started talking to their friends in the White House and said you have to do something about this.  [00:25:00] We can\u2019t just let these kids in Sweden with these weird nicknames that are all druggie and alcoholics and sex-craved people, whatever, just weird guys; you can\u2019t let them ruin our business.\n\nSo, the White House eventually invited the Swedish Minister of Justice to come over and talk about Pirate Bay as an issue.  The Minister of Justice informed them that according to Swedish law, a minister cannot tell the prosecutors what to focus on.  Then he went back home to Sweden and he told the prosecutor that you have to focus on file-sharing systems using torrents because otherwise the US has said that we will stop trading with Sweden, so we can\u2019t sell Volvos, we can\u2019t sell ABBA CDs whatsoever to the United States, and they\u2019re threatening to go to the World Trade Organization and asking to put Sweden on the list together with Palestine and Cuba, that you\u2019re not allowed to trade with these countries.  So, the prosecutors in Sweden got this from the Minister of Justice, that you have to focus on this and they said \u2013 [MUSIC] basically, they said but it\u2019s not illegal.  Everything is legal and said we don\u2019t care.\n\nJACK:\tPeter thought that what they were doing was legal because they weren\u2019t hosting any of this pirated material themselves.  They compared what they were doing to a phone book or search engine, and the Swedish police sided with them on that, agreeing it was legal.  But the guys at The Pirate Bay saw signs that pressure was mounting to take them down anyway.  But they were ready; their servers were hosted in a banking data center, untouchable by police.  There would be no way for the police to raid them there.\n\nPETER:\tBut they did anyhow.  A few people lost their job for actually letting them in because they didn\u2019t have this jurisdiction.  They came with fifty, sixty cops, raided The Pirate Bay, arrested people.\n\nJACK:\tThe police arrested Peter, Gottfrid, and Fredrik.\n\nPETER:\tThey didn\u2019t know what they were doing.  They took mice, speakers from everyone, they arrested our lawyer which was kind of funny because they were asking which lawyers we want and when we asked \u2013 or when Gottfrid asked for his lawyer, they just said you can\u2019t have him.  Then he said why can\u2019t I have my lawyer?  Then had to agree that \u2013 or admit that he\u2019s also arrested.  It was a very bizarre situation.\n\nJACK:\tOkay, so there you go.  Story\u2019s over, right?  The three guys from The Pirate Bay arrested and their servers were taken down.  Yeah, no.  Nice try.  Peter, Fredrik, and Gottfrid were arrested but the way Swedish courts work is that there needed to be a trial and since these were not violent criminals, they were allowed to go home until their trial.  So, pretty much the same day they were arrested and the site was taken down, they immediately started working to get it back up.  [MUSIC] They were not fazed by this takedown or arrest at all.\n\nPETER:\tYeah, exactly.  Why should we close it down?  It was legal.  It was fun.  We were already fucked.  It\u2019s kind of like, there\u2019s no point in bringing it down.  We didn\u2019t want to let them win.\n\nJACK:\tThey knew that what they had was powerful, revolutionary almost.  It was challenging big media industries all over the world and they fully believed that what they were doing was right.  The Pirate Bay was down for a total of three days as a result of this raid and arrest, and then the site came back up but this time it was hosted in the Netherlands.\n\nPETER:\tYes, I think it was Holland mostly.  We started doing something else after the raid.  Instead of having the servers in one place, we put up basically a front-end load balancer at one location and then we had a backup location for that.  Then we started loaning or renting machines from people we knew.\n\nJACK:\tYeah, so they didn\u2019t want The Pirate Bay to have one point of failure.  They started hosting the website in multiple locations at once which would make it fully redundant.  This way, if one of the hosting providers went down, there would be another ready and the cops would have to do some kind of international coordinated raid to take them out this time.  So, the thing is, is like if the White House is putting pressure on Sweden to say stop these guys and then they say okay, well, we raided them and we arrested them, and then you get it back up again, I\u2019m surprised the White House didn\u2019t say again, look, they\u2019ve still got it up.  Go ahead, stop them for real this time.  Like, why are you letting them still run this?  Then oh, well, maybe Sweden was saying well, we got a court date coming up so we\u2019re gonna sort it out in court, or maybe something else was going on.  Do you know?\n\nPETER:\tWell, we tried getting to know what happened and then they said we\u2019ll be totally open about all of the communication with the White House that we\u2019ve had and we\u2019re gonna have \u2013 everything\u2019s gonna be totally transparent.  Then over 700 documents are still marked Top Secret about what happened between Sweden and the White House regarding this case, so we don\u2019t really know what happened, all of the details, and that\u2019s kind of an interesting thing that I want to see.  Maybe when I\u2019m like, [00:30:00] eighty years old they\u2019ll actually reveal all of the papers or someone leaks it on one of the favorite platforms we have.\n\nBut yeah, I think also Sweden have a really \u2013 there\u2019s a really open political discussion in Sweden and it\u2019s a small country.  We\u2019re very strong when it comes to the rights we have as citizens and all of these things.  Previously, Sweden wasn\u2019t like these pussies that they are today with being totally scared of everyone, but we even \u2013 Sweden even had a prime minister that said that the US were fucking murderers because of the Vietnam war and stuff, so there is a history of Sweden not being \u2013 not having to listen to the United States and also being very proud of its independence and the political openness of being able to actually go be a little bit punk.\n\nJACK:\t[MUSIC] By this time, they really started getting a lot of takedown notices, DMCA violations, lawsuits filed against them, and cease and desist letters.\n\nPETER:\tDisney sent a few, Dreamworks sent the best ones, Apple sent a few, like State TV, but I think some days we got a few thousand DMCA takedown notices which is interesting because Sweden\u2019s not part of United States.  We very often replied exactly that, that we know that United States have this law called DMCA.  It\u2019s not applicable outside of the United States and I know you like to invade countries because \u2013 and enforcing your law and so on, but you have to do it before you can actually tell us to use your law, so we basically told them fuck you, fuck off.  We were very aggressive in replies to these companies that sent DMCA takedown notices.\n\nJACK:\tYeah, what were some of the other replies you sent them?\n\nPETER:\tWell, some of the favorite ones were when we told them which batons to put up their asses, or we \u2013 I remember I sent a map once of where Sweden was and where the United States was and like, here\u2019s places to bomb in Sweden \u2018cause you usually bomb when you don\u2019t like us.  I sent \u2013 once I sent a picture of a polar bear as a reply to I think Dreamworks as well, and they were kind of confused about \u2013 they just replied well, why did you send a picture of a polar bear?  I said it\u2019s \u2013 this polar bear is standing outside of my kitchen right now and he\u2019s trying to kill me \u2018cause polar bears are very aggressive and they like to eat people, so I don\u2019t really care about corporate issues right now.  Polar bears are dangerous.  Corporate is not important.  So, they were very confused with our replies.  They\u2019re just very used to people listening to like oh shit, I got a legal threat, I\u2019m gonna listen to them, they have all of the power, and just close down whatever.  But we did the opposite; we just told them to fuck off aggressively, very \u2013 let\u2019s say very teenager kind of words, so a lot of fuck, a lot of bad jokes, aggressiveness, and then we published all of them on The Pirate Bay just to be \u2013 make them even more pissed with us.\n\nJACK:\tThere\u2019s a documentary about some of this called The Pirate Bay AFK and in it, Gottfrid is asked what he did with the DMCA takedown notices and he says well, the first hundred times we\u2019d get it from someone we\u2019d just tell them to contact the person who\u2019s sharing and uploading the files and that The Pirate Bay does not store any copyrighted material.  Then he says after the hundredth takedown notice that he would lose his patience and that\u2019s when they\u2019d reply with all these crude comments.  One of the media companies that were really upset with The Pirate Bay was a company called MediaDefender.\n\nPETER:\tSo, MediaDefender was this really \u2013 it was \u2013 I think it\u2019s a spin-off from Universal, I think.  I can\u2019t remember now; it\u2019s ages ago.  But it was a company that basically protected media on the internet.  That was their business thing.  So, they uploaded \u2013 let\u2019s say Spider-Man is out and people start pirating Spider-Man.  They would upload a fake Spider-Man torrent and when people start downloading it, they would take the IP address and then go to the internet provider, ask about the customer data, and then send you a threatening letter and say you have to pay $500 or we\u2019re gonna take you to court.\n\nJACK:\tNow, what\u2019s fascinating is that this fake Spider-Man film they listed on The Pirate Bay wasn\u2019t actually the Spider-Man film.  It was just a dummy video the same size and format as a movie, but there was nothing in it.  So, it\u2019s crazy that people were fined $500 for downloading a film that had absolutely nothing to do with Spider-Man except for the filename.\n\nPETER:\tThese were really annoying people \u2018cause they were trying to make money out of basically scamming people.  A lot of \u2013 it was not only on Pirate Bay but on all of the torrent sites and other file-sharing systems.  So, an acquaintance to us [00:35:00] actually hacked them [MUSIC] and got full access to their e-mail boxes and their internal network and their voiceover IP system and everything.  It was very interesting times because they got paid a shitload of money to \u2013 from the clients.  Like, Sony and these guys paid them millions to protect stuff on the internet.  They were lying quite a lot to their clients about how much they were helping.  The interesting thing was that we \u2013 since we got the copies of the e-mails; we had like, every time they got an e-mail, we had it a second later because it was forwarded to us automatically.\n\nThese e-mails always included which IP ranges they were using to share movies on The Pirate Bay, so we of course blocked them before they could even start using these services and messing with The Pirate Bay users.  It was \u2013 when we realized that they were doing all of this, then they sent out a lot of press releases saying how effective they were about getting people \u2013 stop people from file sharing.  So, we made it kind of our thing that we would mess with them.  This guy that\u2019s our acquaintance, he actually leaked all of the \u2013 all of their software that they made and I think a lot of e-mail as well and some phone calls, very funny phone calls.  They are still on Pirate Bay, I think, that you can download and listen to them.\n\nJACK:\tOh, right.  Okay, I have to download this and listen.\n\nMDEFENDER:\tHello?\n\nAGO:\tYes.\n\nMDEFENDER:\tHi, this is Ben\u2026\n\nAGO:\tHello.\n\nMDEFENDER:\t\u2026Grodsky, MediaDefender.\n\nJACK:\tThis is a call between MediaDefender and the attorney general\u2019s office in New York.  Apparently MediaDefender was helping them investigate a child porn case but on this call, they\u2019re talking about e-mails that got leaked and how there must be a hacker somewhere but neither side wants to admit there\u2019s a hacker in their network.\n\nMDEFENDER:\tWe\u2019ll talk by phone unless we can share some PGP keys for e-mail.  If you can check on your end again, just \u2013 and I\u2019m checking on my end, too.  I\u2019m not accusing you guys but I think we need to \u2013 under the sensitivity of this thing, we both need to make sure that both of our systems are secure on both ends, both our mail servers and our networks to make sure that whoever saw that e-mail didn\u2019t see it on either of our mail servers or on the inside of either of our networks.\n\nAGO:\tRight.\n\nJACK:\tSo, MediaDefender knew someone had seen their e-mails and had a hunch that maybe it was the guys from The Pirate Bay but were sort of dumbfounded as to what to do.\n\nMDEFENDER:\tYou know, somebody\u2019s got access to a mail server, they might have access to other machines on the network, and the argument goes that even though the data that\u2019s being sent from us to you in a secure fashion is secure, if there\u2019s somebody sniffing around on your network or on our network, it\u2019s not secure on either end before it gets into the tunnel.\n\nAGO:\tOkay.\n\nMDEFENDER:\tSo, yeah, I think we\u2019re good.\n\nPETER:\tSo, we actually sued them in the end.  So, we went to the cops in Sweden, said that this company is illegally using our service and they\u2019re breaking the terms of service and that they know that they\u2019re doing it, so they\u2019re actually violating our copyright, so we sued them over that in Sweden.\n\nJACK:\tSo, this lawsuit was more of a joke.  The Pirate Bay guys knew they had no rights when it came to imposing their website\u2019s rules on a US company, and that was kinda the point of the lawsuit, to show them how silly it seemed to go after some guys in another country for violating your arbitrary rules.  But MediaDefender wasn\u2019t just waging legal threats on The Pirate Bay; they were actively attacking Pirate Bay\u2019s website.  In fact, some of the e-mails that got leaked had discussed how MediaDefender was conducting denial-of-service attacks on The Pirate Bay.  So now, The Pirate Bay was seeing how MediaDefender was poisoning The Pirate Bay with fake torrents and DDossing them.\n\nPETER:\tYeah, they did quite a lot of those.  We used that as evidence against them.\n\nJACK:\tSo, you decided to pick up the phone and dial the CEO of MediaDefender to say cut it out?\n\nPETER:\tYeah.  It\u2019s funny.  That\u2019s the thing, it\u2019s the irony.  I love the irony.  So, yeah, why not?  We had like, a banter going.  I remember one time I was actually reading their e-mail.  It was coming into my e-mail box and I was talking to him on the phone about something.  I think I told him that we\u2019re \u2013 handed over the lawsuit against them and so on and he was laughing about that.  He said fuck you and so on.  Then I saw that there was an e-mail from the reception of MediaDefender saying someone called John had a birthday, so the cake is available now in the reception; everyone come have cake.  Then it said oh, I\u2019m busy, I have to go, and it said oh, enjoy the cake.  He didn\u2019t react to that.  I think maybe he understood afterwards that oh my god, the guy was reading my e-mail all along.  I really hope that he, you know, understood how much better we are than him.\n\nJACK:\tBut you accused a police investigator of [00:40:00] conflict of interest with MediaDefender\u2026\n\nPETER:\tYes.\n\nJACK:\t\u2026and how did you know that?\n\nPETER:\tSo, this is the guy that made \u2013 for two and a half years, he was the guy who did The Pirate Bay investigation, right?  So, the \u2013 after the raid he was the head cop for the whole investigation.  So, we were in touch with him quite often.  Since there was a lot of other machines that were actually taken down during The Pirate Bay raid, we asked for some of them to be returned.  There were a lot of political organizations that had their machines, so we were many people in the group and around The Pirate Bay group that had a lot of contact with him, so we knew him quite well.  One of the guys he called in as a witness during the investigation actually just as a joke added him on Facebook.\n\nFacebook was kind of new and you still had this thing called networks on Facebook, so when you joined Facebook you would say I\u2019m in this network; I work for the cops or whatever.  The way we found out that he started working for Warner Brothers was that he changed network on Facebook from Swedish Police to Warner Brothers the day after he quit being a cop which is the day he handed over the final investigation of The Pirate Bay.  So, we reported this to the police and to the prosecutor and the whole \u2013 and to the court, everything.  This was also the guy that we had during the whole investigation period.  We also filed criminal complaints against MediaDefender, to him actually, and he was the one who was supposed to investigate that.\n\nWe didn\u2019t know that he actually was working or he was going to start working for the \u2013 he was already \u2013 he had a contract and everything almost a year before he handed over the investigation.  But in Sweden, it turns out that there was no law against police actually starting working for one of the parties in a criminal case because Sweden is very naive when it comes to this, because everyone in Scandinavia has had a really privileged, blessed, uncorrupt state for a long while, so all of a sudden these very corrupt companies come over and see like oh, it\u2019s totally fine to employ a cop.  Let\u2019s do that.\n\nJACK:\tOkay, so where are we now?  Two raids by the cops, their servers are seized, arrested, DDoS attacked from the media industry, but this is just a warm-up.  We\u2019re only in the year 2008 at this point of the story and the site is still up today, so there\u2019s another thirteen years of battles left in this story.  So, stay with us through the break to hear the rest.  In your opinion, is there anything that is \u2013 that \u2013 I mean, don\u2019t you think that \u2013 regarding copyright, is there anything that should be copyrighted and protected?  Because if somebody makes great art and then somebody just says okay, I\u2019m gonna sell this for half price on my website or give it away free, is that \u2013 how \u2013 where is your justification for zero copyright or do you even believe there should never be?\n\nPETER:\tWell, first of all, if you look at what copyright started out as being, the whole idea of copyright was to make sure that a copy was the correct copy, that no one changed and altered the content of a book, for instance, that you would know that if I read this book it will be the same thing that the author has written because it was important pieces of information that he wanted not to be distorted or changed somewhere along the road.  That was copyright, and then someone made it into some sort of financial system.  For me, the whole thing is like, as an individual, I should not be limited in my access to information.  Between companies, whatever kind of business deal they work out, that\u2019s up to them.\n\nI don\u2019t even consider that as copyright.  They use copyright as the grounds for that.  But for me, the problem is when copyright becomes the default censorship method.  Because we\u2019ve had a limitation before of how many physical copies we can produce, how to distribute, there was actual costs involved with distribution.  With the internet, everything changed.  All of a sudden, if you would pay for every song on the internet, just had access to them, you would have to pay so many millions of whatever.  It doesn\u2019t make sense because we\u2019ve altered the way that we use arts, we use any type of culture, right?  So, we also need to alter the way we look at financial renumeration when it comes to this.  So, I think that we solved the distribution method with the internet which also needed the payment method to change or the financing of culture.\n\nThe problem is that when you talk to people about copyright, you end up talking to a lawyer from a company that owns someone else\u2019s work.  You never really talk to an artist about copyright.  For most artists, it\u2019s more important to actually build a fanbase that will be able to help them pay bills by going to a concert or [00:45:00] whatever that pays them actual money, because most of the money when it comes to music or movies, they actually go to the companies and not to the producers of the content, and then the companies say that they\u2019re there to protect the people that actually steal the money from.  It\u2019s an unjust system and I can\u2019t really accept that because it\u2019s bad for me, it\u2019s bad for the artists.  We never said that we\u2019re against people getting paid for content.  It\u2019s just that we need to find a new method of actually renumerating them.\n\nIf it\u2019s based on tax or Patreon in your case, for instance, that\u2019s much more interesting and much fairer because you take out some sort of middle man that is controlling who gets access to things.  A typical example is like, today we think we solve this thing of music distribution with Spotify, but if you look at the countries like Brazil, Kosovo, or poorer countries, poorer nations, Spotify is not interesting on being available in these regions, so people don\u2019t have access to music the same way there.  For them, it\u2019s really vital that there are torrent sites out there that can actually download music from to be able to listen to them at all, because they are not served by some sort of markets.  For me, it\u2019s about the fairness of access to information.  Then it\u2019s a separate question on how to make sure that artists can actually make money from this, because that\u2019s not the most important thing but if they make great art, they will make money from it somehow.  It\u2019s always been the case, but it\u2019s never been the case that you make your money from \u2013 it\u2019s very few people that make their money from copyright.\n\nJACK:\tOh, and if you\u2019re wondering what they would do if someone were to put child porn or other horrible things up on Pirate Bay, they would delete that.  They had a moderation team that would go through and clear certain stuff out.  If you remember, they were arrested in 2006 for running this thing, and so on February 16, 2009, their trial started.  [BACKGROUND TALK] They were accused of violating Swedish copyright law.  The prosecution team had lawyers from Hollywood there.  That documentary called The Pirate Bay AFK does a good job at documenting this court case.  You can see all three of them up there getting questioned on the stand, and I have to say they acted flippant on the stand, almost like they weren\u2019t taking this seriously at all.\n\nSomeone asked Gottfrid if he\u2019s a computer genius during the trial, and this is what it sounded like in the Swedish courtroom.  [SWEDISH] But when the prosecutor asked him if he can elaborate on what kind of competencies he has, he refused to answer that, saying that it doesn\u2019t seem like the appropriate time for him to go over his resume and that question is just too hard to answer.  [SWEDISH]  They asked Peter how he met Fredrik and Gottfrid, and he said oh, I don\u2019t remember; probably in a chatroom or something.  The prosecutor said no, no, no; when did you meet them IRL?  Someone in the trial was like, what\u2019s IRL mean?  The prosecutor said\u2026\n\nPROSECUTOR:\tIn real life.\n\nJACK:\tPeter said something like\u2026\n\nPETER:\tI really hate the term IRL because it minimizes us and it minimizes the importance of the internet.  I think we are always ourselves on the internet now.  It\u2019s very rarely we\u2019re not ourselves on the internet.  We would be more open and honest on the internet than we are in \u2013 out of the internet, so I think it\u2019s a old saying that doesn\u2019t really exist anymore.  I\u2019ve always been promoting the concept of AFK, away from keyboard, instead of in real life because I always wanted people to understand that the internet is for real and it\u2019s actually where most of our lives are today.\n\nJACK:\tYou can imagine how this trial went when three guys continued to answer questions in this way.  But honestly, this is actually the way lawyers talk, with extreme precision and accuracy, without volunteering any extra details to help the other side.  But the prosecution team was dumbfounded by the way they acted in court.  The responses were accurate but just extremely specific and somewhat ideological and there were a lot of people who came to attend this trial, fans of The Pirate Bay.\n\nPETER:\tEveryone was totally on our side.  There were chants outside and then The Pirate Party had started a few years before and they were like, this was their way of actually getting a lot of attention, so they had people there making cookies and we pirated recipes, and it was very \u2013 it was a festival thing going on.  The attention in Scandinavia was huge.  It was insane.  The court case was the first court case where it was actually distributed on Swedish radio, so live, you could listen into the court case.  It was going on for three weeks so we had seven hours, eight hours per day that was live radio from the court case.  It was all very new for everyone involved because the judge had never seen anything like it.  [00:50:00] We\u2019ve never been to court before and it was just, the defense was very confused about \u2013 they were all very \u2013 we had famous lawyers, all of us, and they were still very confused about how big this was and they didn\u2019t really understand all of a sudden the BBC is there and interviewing them about things and how Swedish legal system works and so on.  It was interesting.  Let\u2019s say that.\n\nJACK:\tAnyway, they lost the court case.  [MUSIC] The judge ruled that they must serve one year in prison and pay thirty million Swedish crowns or about 3.6 million in US in penalties.\n\nPETER:\tWell, the case was kind of corrupt.  Let\u2019s be honest.  I got convicted for things that never happened which is kind of strange.  They said I was responsible for some servers that was not even in the rest \u2013 in the raid.  They didn\u2019t take any of those machines, but the judge didn\u2019t understand what that meant which is kind of interesting because yeah, it was a very corrupt, weird court case.  We kind of figured that out after the first two, three days that something was off.  So, we started treating it more as a theatre performance than actual court case.  Actually, before the court case we said that we wanted to move the court from being in Stockholm\u2019s normal, small court because we needed a bigger audience, because we had a huge audience.  We needed like, let\u2019s say a theatre with 80,000 seats so all of our fans can visit and be part of the court case.  That was the attitude we had towards this, that it\u2019s a theatre piece.  We called it the spectrial; it was spectacle trial.  Of course, it\u2019s not really good advice in how the court will treat you when you treat them as being some sort of theatre rather \u2013 performance rather than actually being some sort of legit court.\n\nJACK:\tSo, after the court case you were convicted of one year in prison.  Well, number one, why didn\u2019t you go prison and number two, why didn\u2019t this take The Pirate Bay down after being convicted of this?  You would think Pirate Bay would be shut down at that point.\n\nPETER:\tWell, why should you go to prison?  That\u2019s a weird\u2026\n\nJACK:\tWell\u2026\n\nPETER:\tI can\u2026\n\nJACK:\tNo, it\u2019s not \u2013 why did \u2013 so, don\u2019t the police \u2013 like, you\u2019re in court; the police say okay, you\u2019re guilty.  Okay, come this way, it\u2019s time for prison.  Right?  You have one year you have to serve.  Why didn\u2019t that just happen immediately?\n\nPETER:\tNo, no.  You\u2019ve seen too many Hollywood movies.  Also, we\u2019re not in Hollywood.\n\nJACK:\tHe goes on to explain the way the system works in Sweden, but the short story is that he appealed the case.  If you appeal, you don\u2019t yet need to go to prison and you can keep living at home and wait for your second trial.  So, in the meantime, they completely ignored any requests to shut The Pirate Bay down.\n\nPETER:\tBecause we didn\u2019t want to.  I think it\u2019s that simple.  It was just not hard to run and it was running in different places and we were in different countries, and we just decided none of us were \u2013 none of us had the interest of going to prison, so we didn\u2019t go.\n\nJACK:\tIt just \u2013 I mean, it doesn\u2019t work that way in the US.  You can\u2019t be arrested and sentenced to a crime that you committed for copyright infringement and then they \u2013 and then just say I appeal this and I\u2019m gonna keep it going.  It\u2019s so weird that you just think that that\u2019s an option and that was what happened.\n\nPETER:\tBut I think it\u2019s weird that you don\u2019t see that as an option.  Why would you have to go to prison for something which is not a crime, and why would you help someone to go \u2013 why would you help the state by voluntarily going to prison for something which is\u2026\n\nJACK:\tWell\u2026\n\nPETER:\tYou know.\n\nJACK:\tWell, it\u2019s not so much that it\u2019s not a crime; it\u2019s that in court, they deemed it as a crime and a jury convicted you of yes, you\u2019re guilty of that crime, so that\u2019s the final verdict there of the court has ruled this way, and so whether you believe it\u2019s a crime or not does not matter anymore \u2018cause the court has ruled a certain way.\n\nPETER:\tI don\u2019t agree.  I don\u2019t agree.  First of all, it was not a valid court, you know.  Okay, going back to the corruption thing; it turned out that the judge in our case was also the chairman for the Pro Copyright Society of Sweden.  I can\u2019t take that seriously when he convicts me of breaking copyright on evidence which was basically look, here are people downloading things from The Pirate Bay.  It says well, tracker is down because we had an \u2013 we didn\u2019t have bandwidth when they were actually doing the evidence, so when they tried downloading things it didn\u2019t work, so all of the screenshots they were using as evidence in the court case actually said Pirate Bay\u2019s not working, so they showed that none of these things has been downloaded from Pirate Bay which was funny but it didn\u2019t help.  But of course, I don\u2019t take that \u2013 it was [00:55:00] totally not a legit court case.  I think also being wanted by Interpol is a better option than going to prison because it gives me the right to say I\u2019ve been wanted by Interpol afterwards.  That\u2019s worthwhile.  I didn\u2019t get a t-shirt but at least I have the saying; I can say I\u2019ve been wanted by Interpol.\n\nJACK:\tWas there fear inside you at all that maybe, just maybe sometime you might get arrested and extradited to the US and spend twenty years in prison?  \u2018Cause I mean, in the US they were \u2013 here \u2013 making huge fines on people for downloading like, one song, like $200,000 or something you\u2019re fined for this, and it was ridiculous stuff going on over here, so I can imagine them catching the kingpin of this and saying not only are you gonna get a million-dollar fine but you\u2019re also gonna go to prison for a long time in the US.  I mean, was there something like that in the back of your head?\n\nPETER:\tI think even though we realized this is a kind of corrupt court case, we also realized that Sweden cannot extradite people that are citizens or neighboring country \u2013 I\u2019m not a Swedish person but the other guys were Swedish.  They would never be able to be extradited to another country for the same crime.  It\u2019s also like this double jeopardy thing that you can\u2019t be convicted in another country for a crime and so on.  The US of course, for \u2013 not only for Pirate Bay but for everything else we\u2019ve been involved in, we couldn\u2019t go \u2013 well, we\u2019re super welcome to go to the US but we will never be able to leave, so we\u2019re just staying out, right?  We were never scared of the US that way but I wouldn\u2019t want to help them.\n\nBut we\u2019re never afraid when it comes to The Pirate Bay.  We\u2019re never afraid of being extradited to the US.  Interesting thing in Sweden is that it\u2019s not illegal to not go to prison.  So when you get sentenced to prison, I think this is actually the case in most countries, is that you\u2019re not the ones getting sentenced.  You don\u2019t have this \u2013 you don\u2019t have \u2013 you can\u2019t force someone to go to prison.  There\u2019s no human emotion that says I want to be locked in, so in Sweden at least, and \u2013 it\u2019s totally up to the \u2013 it\u2019s the state that gets sentenced to put you in prison, not you as a person, so like, technically state has the responsibility of locking you up.  You don\u2019t have to help whatsoever, which also means that it\u2019s not illegal in Sweden to actually escape from prison because it\u2019s a human trait that you don\u2019t want to be locked up, so it\u2019s the state that is forced to keep you in.\n\nIt\u2019s not your job to be in prison.  No one wants to be locked up, so you can\u2019t force someone to change to be inhumane against themselves.  That\u2019s just bizarre.  I didn\u2019t want to help them.  I travelled all over Europe with my normal passport.  I didn\u2019t get arrested even though I was on the Interpol Most Wanted list.  I got kind of upset about that because there\u2019s actual criminals that do exactly the same and don\u2019t get caught and that kind of pisses me off.  Like, the thing is, Interpol is really crap at arresting people.  Seriously.  That\u2019s the problem that someone should actually deal with and having experience in that field, I know how badly they suck.\n\nJACK:\t[MUSIC] Sweden did try to stop them.  They mandated that all ISPs not do business with The Pirate Bay which was the first time that Sweden has ever made such a mandate.  Can you imagine a government telling all ISPs to not do business with a certain company?  It\u2019s really incredible.\n\nPETER:\tI think from a standpoint of the companies, they were kind of relieved probably that they didn\u2019t have to offer that, but I think Pirate Bay had already left Sweden quite a long while ago because of \u2013 basically we owed money to every Swedish ISP anyhow because we didn\u2019t pay the bandwidth bills, right?  So, kind of left and did the other things which were other countries and other places which were more interesting to mess with as well.  Also, a lot of the decisions on where to move Pirate Bay and what to do was also to influence the political discourse in those countries, so we decided to let The Pirate Party host Pirate Bay because we wanted it to be a political statement from them saying we are a political party and we\u2019re running a site that we think is a political project here.  Are you going to censor a political party for standing up to the ideologists which would be illegal in most countries?\n\nJACK:\tAh, yes; The Pirate Party.  So, this is a political party in Sweden which basically has three core values; they want transparent government, more privacy for people, and they want to revise the patent or copyright system.  Now, this Pirate Party was establishing itself independently from The Pirate Bay.  There was no affiliation actually, but The Pirate Party just wasn\u2019t getting much airtime or taken seriously until The Pirate Bay court case.  Suddenly, the guy behind The Pirate Party was being interviewed everywhere to get his opinion on what\u2019s happening, and thus The Pirate Party became more known.  But to add to that, The Pirate Bay [01:00:00] was winning the hearts of people everywhere.\n\nPETER:\tAfter the court case when we lost, there was \u2013 the biggest newspaper in Sweden had this typical poll on the front page of a newspaper saying was it right or wrong that they got convicted?  99% said it was wrong that we got convicted.  It was very obviously that we had the full support of the public.\n\nJACK:\tSo, if you have a bunch of people all pumped up and excited about The Pirate Bay, The Pirate Party became their natural home.  People started voting for The Pirate Party in elections.  In the 2009 elections, The Pirate Party actually got 7% of the vote.  It was a growing movement in Sweden but there were also Pirate Parties springing up in other countries, too.  So for a while they tried hosting The Pirate Bay at The Pirate Party\u2019s data center in order to try to gain some sort of protection.\n\nPETER:\tIt would be political censorship disconnecting them because if you disconnect Pirate Bay, you also disconnect the political party\u2019s website and access to the internet which is illegal in most countries.  So, it was a big gamble for them and I think it was also important that they did that and it was kind of funny as well, I think, especially the whole idea was actually \u2013 The Pirate Party was elected to the European parliament which is kind of a big thing as well, so we had this idea that we could maybe run Pirate Bay\u2019s \u2013 basically the front end of Pirate Bay, the load balancer part would run inside the European Union parliament as for the lols, basically, because it would be funny.\n\nJACK:\tThat\u2019s the interesting thing about The Pirate Bay, is how they were able to shape political discourse about copyright and patents.  I mean, they weren\u2019t hiding or running from anyone.  No, they were taking their flag and running it with full force right into the center of European parliament.  It\u2019s just incredible.  What Disney did next was kind of funny.  First, listen to this anti-piracy message which you had to watch just before you could watch one of their DVDs.\n\nHOST:\t[MUSIC] In every great Disney DVD, know the heroes and the villains.  But with pirated DVD copies, there are only ever villains.  DVD piracy is a crime and needs to be stopped.  The inferior quality of these pirated DVDs will spoil your enjoyment of watching the film.\n\nJACK:\tBut in the same breath, one of Disney\u2019s blockbuster films was Pirates of the Caribbean.\n\nPETER:\tThey realized from Hollywood that calling us pirates were not effective in terms of getting people to not like us.  It was kind of funny, so they changed their whole concept of how to attack The Pirate Bay, saying we were like a cult.  It was kinda funny because they were \u2013 in every single interview with the lawyers in Europe for Hollywood, like the lobbyists and lawyers that work for Hollywood in Europe, they were always saying like, this kopimist cult, kopimist cult all the time.  I\u2019ve always had this idea that if someone calls you something, then you make that cool.\n\nFound out by researching a little bit that actually in Sweden, you can start your own religion.  It\u2019s fifty euros.  Then you can register basically whatever you want as a religion.  It would be an official religion recognized by the state.  So, we had some friends and then we talked about this, and then we registered the Church of Kopimism in Sweden.  I believe that we started, as I mentioned to you, we start life with being a copy of our parents.  Our DNA is copied and remixed into a new human being and all of \u2013 everything we learn is from a book that we copy the information out of, so it\u2019s like \u2013 and kind of the idea of kopimism is this whole concept of instead of \u2013 the Mormon church, they have this thing that everyone who\u2019s a Mormon is also a priest.\n\nSo, I came up with this idea at like, 2:00 AM in the middle of the night, a little bit tired, and I was thinking what if everyone is a priest in the kopimist society and we can have priest-to-priest communication which is basically file-sharing.  That would actually be protected as a religious service and it would be a confession which is actually illegal to listen in on, which means that if you find someone actually file-sharing and let\u2019s say that they\u2019re a kopimist and they were talking to their priest, you would have violated their religious right which is four years of prison minimum in most European countries.  It was just really funny.  It\u2019s actually a recognized religion in Sweden.  It\u2019s like, 30,000 members, something like that, that are kopimists.\n\nJACK:\tThe media companies were getting really frustrated and were feeling like they couldn\u2019t go after The Pirate Bay directly.  So, they came up with an indirect way of tackling the problem; they pressured Google to take down links to content that was on The Pirate Bay, [01:05:00] like links to torrents and stuff, and Google took down direct links to torrents on The Pirate Bay but they kept up a link to The Pirate Bay in their search engine.  Then the media companies pressured Facebook to remove all links to The Pirate Bay, and a lot of people on Facebook were sharing links to certain songs and videos that were on the site.\n\nPETER:\tYeah, but that\u2019s the thing; Pirate Bay \u2013 kind of proud of it.  It\u2019s like, a few things I\u2019m really proud of and one thing is that we\u2019re \u2013 been the most-censored website in the world and it\u2019s always for different reasons.  Pirate Bay was censored \u2013 one of the first countries that censored Pirate Bay was China because of \u2013 they didn\u2019t like the freedom of speech aspect of Pirate Bay.  It was not really into the pirating.  It would also be very ironic if China complained about piracy, but \u2013 so they just banned Pirate Bay for freedom of speech problems.  When Facebook started blocking Pirate Bay links, it was probably among the first things that they ever blocked.  It\u2019s interesting that you would still be able to talk about the KKK and promoting the KKK but you are not allowed to send a link to your home video that you shared using torrents.\n\nWe\u2019ve always been at the forefront of censorship rather than anything else.  That\u2019s for good and bad because a lot of these \u2013 a lot of countries or systems, they kind of use the whole idea that oh, we should block The Pirate Bay because people can illegally download something and then they can go to some court case and \u2013 court somewhere and they say oh, that sounds reasonable.  Then they have kind of a precedent that oh, then we have a blocking system in place.  Then we just add the next, the next, the next thing.  We\u2019ve kind of been abused quite a lot to bring out filters and block lists.  In Denmark, for instance, Pirate Bay was one of the first websites that also got blocked because of piracy.  When they had the \u2013 they forced the internet providers to block Pirate Bay and DNS.  So all of a sudden they had the DNS blocking system in place.\n\nJACK:\tWhoa, hold on a second; the whole country of Denmark blocked The Pirate Bay using a DNS block list?  Hold on, let me look this up.  Okay, yeah, it looks like there was a district court in Denmark which said the largest ISP in Denmark was assisting its customers in conducting copyright infringement and was ordered to block access to the site.  So, the largest ISP in Denmark put in place a DNS block so users couldn\u2019t get to The Pirate Bay.  Now, this is really fascinating to me.  So first, a DNS is how URLs get resolved to IP addresses.  So like, when you type in google.com into your browser, your computer and all the routers in the world have no idea where you\u2019re trying to access so before it can do anything, it first asks a DNS server hey, what\u2019s the IP address for google.com?\n\nThen the DNS server responds with that IP and from there, now your computer and all the routers know how to route that traffic properly.  But in this case, the DNS server was saying no, I have no idea what the IP address is for The Pirate Bay, which meant users couldn\u2019t get to the site.  So, what\u2019s fascinating to me here is I don\u2019t think ISPs should be blocking content that you\u2019re specifically asking for.  You give money to an ISP so that they can give you internet access.  That\u2019s their job.  That\u2019s what you\u2019re buying, a connection to the internet, but now this ISP is saying well, actually, there are certain websites that you can\u2019t go to if you use us.  To me, that\u2019s a gross overreach of control.  The internet should be open and once you get on it, you should be freely allowed to go wherever you want.\n\nBut here is a Danish ISP controlling where you can or can\u2019t go, and to top it all off, this was a government order.  When a government mandates that you\u2019re not allowed to visit a certain website, that\u2019s the opposite of freedom because this can easily be abused.  Look at North Korea or China and how they block users from going to so many foreign websites.  Those governments want to control the news and facts and only let you go to websites that they can control these things.  So, once a block list is put in place, it\u2019s pretty easy for the government to then say oh yeah, let\u2019s also block this and block that, too.  Before you know it, your government is controlling way too much of what you\u2019re allowed to see and not see.  Before I get off this tangent here, there are twenty-nine countries in the world who have blocked The Pirate Bay.  Lots of countries in Europe block access.  Australia, China, Russia, even Iran, and most of them have blocked it at an ISP level, completely blocking users from going to certain IPs, so even if you had a DNS server that resolved the IP, the ISPs in these countries will still not route traffic to The Pirate Bay in any way.\n\nWe should all agree it\u2019s wrong when governments take away our internet whether it\u2019s hitting a full kill switch, taking out the [01:10:00] entire internet, or just blocking one site.  Anyway, in May of 2009, The Pirate Bay suffered another takedown.  In order for them to be up, they need a hosting provider and an ISP, or internet connection.  Well, the media industry found out what ISPs that The Pirate Bay was using and slapped them with some pretty serious lawsuits, saying if they continued to provide internet connectivity to The Pirate Bay, there will be a bunch of legal trouble coming their way.  So, three of the ISPs that The Pirate Bay were using all disconnected The Pirate Bay from the internet, resulting in the site going down.\n\nPETER:\t[MUSIC] Yeah, that happened quite a lot.  Again, it\u2019s like the people making advertising on Pirate Bay; they got called by these record companies and so on, said we\u2019re gonna sue you for aiding with copyright infringement if you don\u2019t stop paying them for advertising or taking the advertising down.  They called the internet provider saying if you don\u2019t take them down we\u2019re gonna sue you for copyright infringement, all of these things.  A lot of these companies were of course kind of afraid of that, so that\u2019s why it became really important to run your own internet provider and that\u2019s \u2013 and all of the projects I do today as well, we also run the internet providers because it\u2019s critical infrastructure to have.  That\u2019s the lesson from that.\n\nJACK:\tOh, right.  Sure, that\u2019s the obvious solution; if every ISP in Sweden has mandated to not do business with you and ISPs in other countries keep pulling the plug, then yeah, it makes sense.  Why not make your own ISP?  This way you can\u2019t get the plug pulled out from the internet anymore.  They weren\u2019t making their own ISP in Sweden; they would make them in multiple countries all over the world.\n\nPETER:\tEvery time Pirate Bay was \u2013 got a new internet connection somewhere, there was also three or four backups waiting that we staged before.  The idea was they will work for one or two or three days at least, then we take one or two or three days to get another one, so it was always one more than one backup all the time.  [MUSIC] It was just \u2013 it was very easy to move around because of the way it was set up, technically.  Every time there was a consequence somewhere, so you go to a new country, they will have to have some law in place, they will have to have the police, to have understanding, and they have to raise the question.  For us, it was also important that it becomes a political topic in those countries so we moved to Italy, we moved to Ukraine, we moved to Russia, we moved to all of these countries.\n\nJACK:\tThey were getting good at finding ways to host this site all over the world, and when one place would take them down, they\u2019d be back up pretty quick with a new site.  At one point they were hosting the site in Mexico.\n\nPETER:\tThe Mexican mob wanted to \u2013 they wanted us to pay money; otherwise they would cut out the power.  So we got power cuts a few times because we didn\u2019t pay the Mexicans.  Yeah, so we\u2019ve been \u2013 even power cuts.\n\nJACK:\tOne place they really wanted to get their site hosted at was in North Korea.\n\nPETER:\tSweden has a weird relationship with North Korea.  They went to Sweden which was kind of socialist and they started doing this thing that they \u2013 they basically tricked Sweden into thinking that they are actually super rich and they got a credit from Sweden and bought a lot of Volvo trucks and everything from Sweden; tractors and so on.  So, Sweden got scammed by North Korea big time, like huge.  Ever since then, North Korea actually has an embassy in Stockholm.  It\u2019s the only embassy North Korea has in Europe, is in Stockholm, and Sweden is one of very few countries that actually has an embassy in North Korea.  So, one time we actually \u2013 on the first of April Fool\u2019s, we actually said that we were going to host Pirate Bay in North Korea as a joke.  It was just kinda funny.  I knew that if you called the North Korean embassy, they will always say no comment to whatever you ask them, which for most journalists means that there\u2019s something to this.\n\nJACK:\tSo, they did their April Fool\u2019s joke saying they\u2019re moving their servers to North Korea, but it was all just talk.  Nothing actually happened.  But then, a few years later, it actually did happen, kind of.  It\u2019s a technical and geeky prank that they did, but I\u2019ll try to explain it.  To start, the people in North Korea just don\u2019t have internet connectivity.  That\u2019s just not a thing.  The government has an information monopoly over people there and they\u2019re just not allowed to go online to see opposing views, but North Korea is connected to the internet.  It\u2019s probably reserved for official business only, so in order to route traffic to and from North Korea, the backbone of the internet, which is the BGP routing protocol, has a map of where North Korean traffic should go.  Well, someone, and I don\u2019t know if it was one of these Pirate Bay guys or a friend of The Pirate Bay, they found an insecure internet backbone router which allowed them to get into it and make configuration changes.  As they looked at this router, they saw that this router was broadcasting the BGP routes for North Korea, so The Pirate Bay guys were able to reconfigure this router and point the traffic to their router and their servers which meant if you trace the packets, it looked like The Pirate Bay was being [01:15:00] hosted in North Korea which is such a hilarious joke.\n\nPETER:\tSince no one figured out for over a week, we just sent out a press release saying it\u2019s obvious that we have the same mutual enemy in the United States and North Korea loves us because we\u2019re for messing with the US economy and common enemies and so on.  Then we just had pictures taken from the North Korean embassy in Stockholm and all of these things, and we were kind of \u2013 it was extremely funny.\n\nJACK:\tWell, at the same time, North Korea\u2019s internet was down, right?\n\nPETER:\tOh, yeah.  It\u2019s so sad.  None of the North Korean citizens can use the internet for like, a week.  It was the worst thing ever that we\u2019ve done, I think.  Our all three people that have access to internet, they were out \u2013 without working internet for those \u2013 that week.  I feel it was \u2013 it\u2019s an okay trade-off.  Seriously, it was an okay \u2013 the trolling was very \u2013 it was one of the best trollings ever done on a technical level, on a network scale, I think.  I really enjoyed the whole thing, especially when people like \u2013 the most clever people really have a hard time understanding how this went down.  I think it was almost a week before they figured out in the end.  Then we got kicked out of that network.  The router was \u2013 got patched.  They put up filters and realized fuck, we\u2019re \u2013 that was not good.\n\nJACK:\tAnother thing they tried to do was buy their own country.\n\nPETER:\tSo, I\u2019m a little bit obsessed with nations and micronations and how a country is formed and why a border is totally straight in some countries and how all of these very arbitrary decisions are made.  There\u2019s this weird old platform outside of England which is called Sealand or \u2013 a few people took it ages ago and said that this is the nation Sealand.\n\nJACK:\tOkay, so the nation of Sealand has a population of two and that\u2019s on a busy day.  I don\u2019t think it occupies any land at all; it\u2019s on the sea in the middle of the English Channel, and it\u2019s just two pillars and a platform connecting them.  It\u2019s an old military fort but sometime ago it was taken over by a pirate radio broadcaster who tried to turn it into his own country.\n\nPETER:\tThe people of Sealand or running Sealand, this family, got kind of old and they wanted to sell the country.  [MUSIC] We were thinking that sounds like a great thing for Pirate Bay to buy and then make our own laws.  This would be \u2013 like, for the lols, a super funny thing.  So, we just put up a web page called buysealand.com and we linked it on the front page of Pirate Bay and said let\u2019s buy our own nation.  I think this was done under the influence of a lot of alcohol.  Maybe two or three days later, still drunk, I saw the prince of Sealand talking to Larry King on CNN with one of the heads of Disney about the problems it would be if Pirate Bay actually got to buy Sealand, because they were taking this seriously.  I think we raised $50,000 in two, three days.  Then they said oh, we want six billion dollars or something like that.  So, we always said we\u2019re gonna do something good with the money if we can\u2019t buy Sealand.  That was also the first time we had money and all of a sudden we started fighting internally about that, so I ended up buying a lot of rainforest in Brazil to get rid of the money.  Then Fredrik and Gottfrid hated me for that afterwards.  I probably got scammed, but hopefully not.\n\nJACK:\tIn July 2010, a hacker from Argentina hacked into The Pirate Bay and exposed a bunch of user details.  It looks like he got into the admin panel which gave him full control of the website.  The Pirate Bay guys took the site down to do some upgrades and saw that this data leak was going on, so they decided to rewrite some of the back end code and resolve this problem.  Then they came back up.\n\nPETER:\tThis is around the time I stopped working with Pirate Bay, I think.  I can\u2019t remember exactly when I left but I think it\u2019s like 2010, 11, 09, something like that.  It was quite a long while ago.  But yeah, there\u2019s\u2026\n\nJACK:\tOkay, so why\u2019d you leave?\n\nPETER:\tI worked \u2013 I had a full-time job.  I worked eight times \u2013 eight hours per day at least.  Maybe ten hours per day on my normal job.  Then The Pirate Bay took eight hours per day; people calling, a lot of journalists called every single day.  It was like, hours and hours and hours I was talking to journalists.  I found it really important to talk to these people because they liked the story of David versus Goliath which meant that we could always talk about the important things for me which was the unfair internet where we don\u2019t have equal access, we have walled gardens, we have paywalls, people that can afford things and people that can\u2019t.  I wanted to actually do something about it.  I wanted to find something else to do than just working on the same thing [01:20:00] because maybe this is also something very Scandinavian, but we have this tradition of kicking out the old and bringing in something new.\n\nWhen we started Pirate Bay and we realized this is gonna \u2013 it started taking off or whatever you want to call it, we had an agreement that we will close down Pirate Bay on our tenth anniversary because if we decide in the beginning that we\u2019re not gonna let anyone shut us down, but when we\u2019re ten years old, we\u2019re gonna just close the site.  We win.  That would have been epic.  I really wanted to do that.  Ended up Pirate Bay didn\u2019t do that.  I\u2019m still kind of upset about it.  But for me, it\u2019s really been really important to find another angle of attacking important questions, like reevaluate new tools, new views of the same problems in society.  I left Pirate Bay because it was kind of the same thing going on and on and on again; same questions, same kind of opponents, and I wanted to mix it up.\n\nSo, I created a payment system for how to create \u2013 or get paid for doing things on the internet which is called Flattr that I rather wanted to focus on instead of Pirate Bay, so I left to work on that instead.  Also, I really hated working with Gottfrid and Fredrik \u2018cause I think they were assholes.  Total objectively, they are assholes.  Also subjectively, they are assholes.  They probably agree but it\u2019s \u2013 I\u2019m the asshole.  We don\u2019t like each other that much, any of us.  It gets kind of tired working with people for too long when you don\u2019t like each other, even though that\u2019s been kind of important that we can focus on the things we did agree on.  I think that was very effective but it\u2019s also really annoying being associated with people you don\u2019t like.\n\nJACK:\t[MUSIC] The trial for their appeal came around and the courts decided they were guilty again, this time shortening their prison sentence by a few months but increasing their fines.\n\nPETER:\tIt\u2019s not a fine.  We never got fines.  That\u2019s an American thing, yeah.\n\nJACK:\tI don\u2019t want to say restitution; it\u2019s a penalty of some kind.  I don\u2019t know what it\u2019s called.\n\nPETER:\tThey forced us having a license agreement but the interesting thing is that\u2019s a clever move of the opponents because if we got fines, they would be \u2013 money we would have to pay to the state.  In Sweden, that would expire after ten years, so then we would not have debts in \u2013 forever, but if it\u2019s personal debt based on a deal with the record companies, it will be forever.  That was their \u2013 it\u2019s a life sentence.  Fines would have been better.\n\nJACK:\t[MUSIC] Peter appealed again which means he didn\u2019t immediately have to go to prison and was free to go home and even travel.  This would be his last appeal, though.  After this, whatever the courts decided, he\u2019d have to comply or as he puts it, the state would have to come get him and force him to comply.  In the meantime, The Pirate Bay continued to stay up, becoming more and more resilient over time.  Another thing that happened at some point was that they got their BGP route sink-holed.  This is a routing protocol used across the internet.  Millions of routers around the world all speak this same protocol to know how to transmit packets everywhere.  Somehow, in a coordinated move, major backbone providers stopped forwarding traffic destined to The Pirate Bay.\n\nAgain, this is another astonishing, incredible thing to do.  The job of a router is to get packets where they need to go.  Its job is not to block or filter traffic.  A firewall\u2019s job is to block traffic, but not only that; they were blocking The Pirate Bay\u2019s BGP routes.  BGP is like a map of the internet.  It\u2019s a protocol, a standard, and it shouldn\u2019t have blocks at that level.  It would be like if your GPS suddenly stopped showing you certain locations because the GPS provider didn\u2019t want you going there.  It\u2019s just crazy to think that a GPS provider would ever restrict people from seeing certain parts of the map, right?  It\u2019s just wrong to do that and that\u2019s similar to what it\u2019s like when these BGP routes get blocked, which is almost completely unheard of.  I bet all my network engineers who are listening right now have never heard of an internet backbone provider having a naughty list that sinkholes certain BGP routes.\n\nAgain, it\u2019s going way too far for an ISP to do that.  But if we back up for a second and look at this, they\u2019ve been taken down at all points of the network.  The endpoint is where their servers are that are hosted, and this has been raided and seized, and ISPs have disconnected them many times.  The midpoint is the BGP [01:25:00] routing table which is sink-holing them, and the other endpoint is that users are getting blocked by their ISPs and DNS servers.  Users who got blocked could still access the site using Tor or VPN to get around these roadblocks because the site was still up and operational.  It\u2019s kind of funny that when these roadblocks would force people to use a VPN, it just made it harder for media giants to find them.  [MUSIC] In 2012, the final appeal was set to take place but the supreme court of Sweden refused to hear the appeal which meant the previous sentence and verdict was upheld.  This meant it was time for Peter, Fredrik, and Gottfrid to all serve their prison time.\n\nI think by then, Fredrik and Gottfrid had moved to some southeast Asian countries, making it harder for the police to find them.  But what\u2019s interesting is immediately after the appeal concluded, The Pirate Bay switched domains.  See, this whole time it was hosted at thepiratebay.org but the .org top-level domain is run by an American company so in theory, now that the last appeal went through, the US authorities could issue a seizure of the .org domain, so they switched it to thepiratebay.se, and .se is a Swedish top-level domain.  Anyway, as you can imagine, even though Peter was sentenced to almost a year in prison, he didn\u2019t voluntarily go.\n\nPETER:\tNo, I decided to run for office, as any criminal would do.  I\u2019m a Finnish citizen and we\u2019re like the kids \u2013 kid brother to Sweden.  A lot of people in Finland are upset that they still have to learn Swedish in school.  There\u2019s a quite big movement from the nationalist movement of Finland that they hate immigrants and they hate Swedish people.  It very often intertwines.  So, I ran in Finland, saying like if you hate Sweden, you should vote for me because I \u2013 if I get into the European Union parliament, I get diplomatic immunity which means I don\u2019t have to go to prison which means that Sweden would be really upset.\n\nJACK:\tWell, did you really feel that way?  Did you feel animosity towards Swedish people?\n\nPETER:\tNo, but for me as a left-wing person, a socialist, I think it was super funny to take the racist votes because they had to decide are you gonna vote for just a racist or for one who really \u2013 it would really be annoying to Sweden which you probably hate a little bit more than just normal immigrants.  That\u2019s kind of like the Finnish situation, a little bit.  So, I kind of stole votes from people I don\u2019t like and made a joke out of it because it was an absurd situation that I should go to prison.  It was absurd that I got listed on the Interpol list.  So, I just made a joke out of it.  Kind of funny that if you \u2013 if I actually got into European Union parliament, I would have gotten diplomatic immunity and they couldn\u2019t have arrested me.  The case would be so old after I would have been in office that it would have been expired.  So, it was kind of a hack.  You talk a lot about hacks but it\u2019s a different level of hack.  It\u2019s a political kind of social engineering stunt.  I just found it too funny not to actually attempt it.  So, that was kind of the thing.  It didn\u2019t work out; I didn\u2019t get enough votes but it wasn\u2019t too far away, actually, from getting enough votes.  Then, of course, I went to prison after that.  [MUSIC] They arrested me like, two days after the election.\n\nJACK:\tIt sounds like all three of you were in prison around the same time, but The Pirate Bay was up at the same time.\n\nPETER:\tYeah, yeah.  Imagine.\n\nJACK:\tHow did that happen?\n\nPETER:\tHave you seen 2001?\n\nJACK:\tA Space Odyssey?  Yeah.\n\nPETER:\tYeah.  Do you remember Hal 9000?\n\nJACK:\tYes.\n\nPETER:\tHe\u2019s the guy running Pirate Bay.  It\u2019s some sort of autonomous machine, you know?  That happens.  I\u2019ve been sued later on.  The most ironic lawsuit is actually going on in Finland where they said that I must be responsible for Pirate Bay still to this day because when I left, I didn\u2019t shut off the machines and they could potentially still be running and they would be the machines still responsible for copyright infringement.  But basically I think that it would be impossible to shut down The Pirate Bay.  It\u2019s like, has its own life.  It\u2019s kind of mythical.  Yeah.  It\u2019s way beyond us.  I don\u2019t believe in any religion but I think that The Pirate Bay is some sort of supernatural being now.  Then I ended up in high-security prison with like, [01:30:00] serial killers and biker gang leaders and so on which was an interesting period.\n\nJACK:\tYeah, that\u2019s one way to describe it.\n\nPETER:\tBut it is fucking interesting, man.  When would you ever hang out with people like that, that you actually know are criminal?  A lot of \u2013 you probably hang out with criminals that you don\u2019t know are criminals, but these are obviously criminals.  They\u2019ve ended up there for obvious reasons and you probably have heard about a few of them if you live in the same country.  You know, you\u2019re not enemies.  They\u2019re not your enemy.  The only enemies \u2013 you have the same enemy.  It\u2019s like, the prison wardens are, the guards, and then the system is kind of your enemy.  It\u2019s like a boys club, more or less.  You\u2019re not afraid of them.  You\u2019re more interested.  If you\u2019re not gonna mess with them, they\u2019re not gonna mess with you and there\u2019s no point in doing that.  Everyone just wants to go out and get time passed and get along.  So, I\u2019ve learned a lot, quite a lot, actually, especially how to not smuggle drugs.  That\u2019s been the biggest lesson.  Like, I know how to not to do things.\n\nJACK:\t[MUSIC] Once they got out of prison, the takedown attempts didn\u2019t stop.  The Swedish court ruled to seize the domain since it was using the .se top-level domain.  Sweden was able to take control of that but quickly after that, The Pirate Bay just came up with six other top-level domains.  There were piratebay.gs, .la, .vg, .am, .mn, and .gd.  This move was coined by some as Hydra Bay because when you cut off the head of The Pirate Bay, six more just grow right back.  Peter got out of prison in 2014, served his punishment, and was no longer with The Pirate Bay, so he was just free to do whatever.  But he still had to pay back those penalties that the courts put on him.\n\nPETER:\tYeah, so it started with forty-something million Swedish and now I think it\u2019s a little bit over 120 with interest.  So, now the goal is to be the guy with the most amount of debt in Sweden ever, in history.  North Korea has a debt to Sweden of two billion Swedish but I calculated in 2052, I think, my debt will be bigger than North Korea\u2019s debt to Sweden.  I\u2019m thinking it\u2019s easier to get the money from North Korea than from me.\n\nJACK:\tSo, what\u2019s my take on copyright and piracy?  Well, it changes over time as new technologies come out and societal norms change.  One of the things that the digital age has done is it\u2019s taken the power away from the traditional gatekeepers.  Like, in the past you used to have to get a record deal in order to get your music out there, but now you can just publish your music directly to Spotify or YouTube.  You want to write a book?  Well, you don\u2019t need a publisher anymore.  Amazon made it so you can publish any eBook you write for free and get it listed in the world\u2019s biggest book store.  Or you can create a movie and make it available to billions of people by just uploading it to YouTube.  We\u2019re now living in an era where artists are more empowered than ever.\n\nSo yeah, I think the copyright system is antiquated and simply can\u2019t work effectively on a global scale.  The RIAA has failed to eliminate piracy and for the past two decades, they\u2019ve spent millions of dollars annoying and enraging the artists\u2019 fanbase.  By suing them, we\u2019ll never fix the problem by attacking fans, because it\u2019s the fans that make the artists popular, and that\u2019s what makes the artists money.  If you eliminate piracy altogether, you also torpedo the ability for many artists to have breakout hits, because things just don\u2019t spread very well when you require all listeners to be licensed properly.  In fact, fans have spoken and they made it clear that they want convenience and are willing to pay a fair price for content.\n\nWhen it\u2019s a lot easier to download a song versus going to the store and buying a CD, then people will download songs.  Napster showed us how easy that can be, and then Apple\u2019s iTunes turned downloading music into a very profitable business where you can download music for a price.  Then Spotify made it even more convenient so that you don\u2019t have to pay per song.  Instead, you get unlimited access to all the music in their catalogue.  While paying for Spotify is entirely optional, many people choose to do it.  But I\u2019m afraid we\u2019re gonna see another uptick in pirated TV and movies soon.  When cable companies were charging $70 a month for access to video content, Netflix came in, made it way cheaper and way more convenient.  In fact, I think a lot of people who were pirating stopped because Netflix gave them the convenience they wanted at a fair price and Spotify was giving them the music they wanted.\n\nBut now a lot more companies are jumping in with Netflix.  You have Hulu, Amazon Prime, Disney +, HBO Max, CBS All Access, the NBC Peacock, and more.  If you pay for all these, you\u2019re looking at $80 a month which is how much cable TV cost when people started abandoning it, and it\u2019s far more inconvenient to try to search in seven places for the show you want to watch.  This is going to cause such a problem that people will [01:35:00] find it more convenient to just pirate shows because they could have all the shows they want in one app instead of seven.  Oh, and Plex is that one app; all the movies you download can be played easily right there and you can also share the movies you downloaded with your friends.  So, I really think that if the movie industry wants less piracy, they should respect the consumer more and deliver the content in a way that\u2019s easy to use and isn\u2019t too expensive.\n\nWhen they\u2019re all competing like they are now and if that\u2019s what\u2019s causing the rise in piracy now, you have to wonder if they even care about piracy since they\u2019re the reason why it\u2019s going up and they\u2019re also making a ton of money at the same time.  But that\u2019s just the big budget TV and movie studios.  Those shows cost millions of dollars to make and have a crew of like, over a hundred people.  Musicians and authors can create wonderful content with way fewer people on a much lower budget.  I think with our current technological status, we should be focusing on how to inspire artists to create wonderful things for us to enjoy.  How can we give them what they need so that they can enrich our lives more?  My favorite music came out in my lifetime but look at any kid today and you\u2019ve got to realize that their favorite music hasn\u2019t even come out yet.\n\nWe want new artists to make an impact on us and that should be our focus; movies, books, and music are considered intellectual property and intellectual property is the fabric of our culture.  When a song is played by more people, the value of that artist just grows bigger, even if they give their content away free.  The more a piece of intellectual property spreads, the better the creator does.  Now they have a fanbase.  Now they have influence.  Now they have people\u2019s attention, and that\u2019s what this is all about; attention, because you can monetize attention.  I don\u2019t think what we have is a copyright problem.  I think we have a marketing and middle man problem, because historically a label or production company would help market your stuff and distribute it and collect money for you.  Major platforms like Amazon, YouTube, and Spotify help in some ways by being a place where you can get a lot of exposure and they\u2019ll pay you for the content that gets consumed.\n\nCrowdfunding is very exciting to me like Kickstarter or Patreon or even Twitch because places like this allow fans to pay creators directly.  It doesn\u2019t matter if the creator is giving the content away free or not; when they make a significant impact on their fans, their fans will be there to help and fund them further.  The thing is, when someone appreciates the impact you\u2019ve made on their lives, they\u2019ll want to pay for it if they can.  Those who can\u2019t can just be little marketers and help spread the word for the artists, making them even more popular.  You simply can\u2019t be a breakout artist if you make art exclusively for people who have enough disposable income to pay for it.  You end up excluding way too many people in the world.  People will always pay artists for things that they want but can\u2019t make themselves and especially in this connected, digital society we live in.\n\nI think giving artists more tools to monetize their content is the best solution we have now.  This way, even if the content is given away free or pirated, fans that love it can come and pay for it.  The world is changing and it\u2019s becoming more common now for fans to just give monthly donations to their favorite creators like on Patreon, or go chuck someone some money over on Kickstarter or buy merch from other creators they like.  Artists who are onboard with this realize the more impact they make on their fans, the more their fans will pay, so they worry a lot less about piracy because they have that direct connection with their fans no matter how they consume the content.  Are you still pirating these days?\n\nPETER:\tOf course.  Aren\u2019t you?\n\nJACK:\tI\u2019m afraid to admit it, though.  That\u2019s the thing.  How come you can be so open about it and not worried about being fined or something?\n\nPETER:\tWell, you think someone\u2019s gonna \u2013 you can just claim to be a kopimist and ask them if they actually violated your religious rights when they found out that you were copying.  You can also use the VPN, you know?  But of course, there\u2019s \u2013 pirating is the best way to find stuff.  Yeah, that never changed.  I still use Spotify and everything else.  The irony of it all is people think that this is something which happened before, but Pirate Bay is bigger than ever in terms of numbers.  It\u2019s just that the rest of the internet grew faster than The Pirate Bay.  It never went away.  It\u2019s like this \u2013 it\u2019s Hal 9000 again.  I think it\u2019s been growing 2% per month forever.\n\nJACK:\tI think I just figured it out; so, Hal 9000 was in outer space and that could mean that you\u2019ve got a satellite in space which hosts The Pirate Bay which \u2013 good luck going to outer space to stop that.  It could just be going perpetually forever up there.\n\nPETER:\tDo you think Earth is not outer space?\n\nJACK:\tIn order for a website to work, a lot of other systems and services also have to be working.  The Pirate Bay has been attacked in almost every way possible but none of these attacks have been successful at taking them down permanently.  The only thing left would be for someone like Microsoft or Google or Apple to block The Pirate Bay in their browsers [01:40:00] because they could.  Google could put a rule in Chrome just blocking all traffic to The Pirate Bay so anyone who uses Chrome can\u2019t get to the site, or Microsoft could put a block within Windows to not allow traffic to The Pirate Bay.  But as far as I know, no browser or operating system has blocked websites because they\u2019ve been on some naughty list.  I think it would be a gross overreach for them to do that.\n\nWhen you buy an operating system or use a browser, you really don\u2019t want them deciding where you can and can\u2019t go.  It\u2019s one thing for them to block insecure sites or sites trying to exploit my computer, but it\u2019s another thing for them to stop users from going to sites based on their ethics or what they deem okay or not.  But it\u2019s fascinating to me at least to see all the many ways that you can be kicked off the internet and how you can get around that and back on.  The Pirate Bay is up and online right now and they even use thepiratebay.org as their address.  But I don\u2019t know the current state of the site, like where it\u2019s hosted or who\u2019s running it.  But it\u2019ll be interesting to see how many more years it continues to operate out there in space somewhere.\n\n(OUTRO):\t[OUTRO MUSIC] A big thank-you to Peter for sharing this story with us.
