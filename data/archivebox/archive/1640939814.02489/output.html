        <p>You have opened the Post Editor, and found within yourself the courage to type Content. Critically, you have yet to click “Publish”.</p>

<p>This is the moment where a lot of people go horribly, irrecoverably wrong.</p>

<p>Yes I absolutely will review your draft, and do not even worry about sending it to me. I just end up saying the same things to everyone anyway, so that simply will not be necessary.</p>

<p>So yeah it looked pretty good. Definitely got words in it. Loved the bit about Galileo. You could probably just publish it and it would be fine.</p>

<p>But what if you don’t want <em>fine</em>?</p>

<p>What if you want it <em>all</em>?</p>

<h1 id="professor-mangopdfs-grand-unified-theory-of-blogging">Professor mangopdf’s Grand Unified Theory of Blogging</h1>

<p>Some people’s Grand Unified Theory of Blogging is all like:</p>

<ol>
  <li>It has a clickbait title</li>
  <li>It’s long enough</li>
  <li>💯 Publish 💯</li>
</ol>

<p>Yes thank you, very cool. But what about</p>

<p><img src="/img/howtoblog/grand_unified_theory.png" alt="The 3 steps"></p>

<p>Do you see the order here? Steps 1 and 2?</p>

<p>You can write a <em>really</em> good blog post with just steps 1 and 2. Actually writing about the topic you’re supposed to be writing about is strictly optional.</p>

<p>But if you leave out the first 2 steps, it <em>doesn’t matter</em> what you’re trying to say.</p>

<p>You clowns are out there trying to tell people</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><em>“I discovered bees can talk but unfortunately they are racist”</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>But everyone stopped reading 3 sentences in because it started out all like</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>honey gets delivered to the supermarket on Fridays, because the drivers have the weekends off, and the supermarkets aren’t open to accept deliveries on Thursdays</em>….</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And so on, and so forth, until the bees <strong>get away with it</strong>.</p>

<hr>

<h1 id="part-1-people-pay-attention-to-what-youre-saying">Part 1: People pay attention to what you’re saying</h1>

<p>You simply wanna make it easy for people to give your post the maximum volume of 👀 eyes emoji 👀</p>

<h2 id="the-title-gets-read-way-more-than-the-rest-so-make-it-count">The title gets read <em>way</em> more than the rest, so make it count</h2>

<p><img src="/img/howtoblog/title_icon.png" alt="The title-tiny"></p>

<p>I dunno about you, but I vaguely read the titles of like 98 things before I click on one. Statistically, your blog post is one of those 98 things, so you <em>better</em> make each character count.</p>

<h3 id="what-should-the-title-look-like">What should the title look like?</h3>

<p>yes yes yes:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>I discovered bees can talk but unfortunately they are racist</p>
</blockquote>

<p>i’m begging you not to do this:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>It’s not just Barry from Bee Movie who might have a secret</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The title should represent the post as much as possible. It should prepare the reader emotionally for the clown carnival ride you are about to take them on.</p>

<p>It should be the <em>opposite</em> of clickbait.</p>

<p>You’ve been hurt so many times before, you brave and vulnerable internet traveller, you. Desperate for #content, asking yourself whether <em>this</em> top 10 article is the one that will finally win her back? I mean hey 10 is a lot of things, so surely your fulfilment lies within one of them.</p>

<p>Clickbait titles burned down my entire village and never text unless they want something. For 💲some reason💲 people keep writing them, though. So now when you look at headlines, you just have to guess what they’re about, like a caveman. A caveman scrolling clickbait titles. Listen, I dunno.</p>

<h3 id="how-about-i-title-it-x-for-fun-and-profit">How about I title it “X for fun and profit?”</h3>

<p>no</p>

<h2 id="listen-i-think-you-should-use-way-more-headings-im-talkin-a-lot">Listen. I think you should use <em>way</em> more headings. I’m talkin’ <em>a lot</em></h2>

<p>I don’t know about you, but when I read something I scroll around all over the place like a functional adult. If you have a lot of headings that describe the words under them, then other adults can stop scrolling and read a paragraph when they see a heading they like.</p>

<p>Paragraphs do a similar thing, but within each heading, letting the reader skip around even more, and we love that for them<span class="littlefoot-footnote__host"><button class="littlefoot-footnote__button littlefoot-footnote__button__ellipsis" id="lf-fnref:onesentence" title="See Footnote 1" aria-expanded="false" data-footnote-button="" data-footnote-id="1" data-footnote-number="1"><svg role="img" aria-labelledby="title-lf-fnref:onesentence" viewBox="0 0 31 6" preserveAspectRatio="xMidYMid"><title id="title-lf-fnref:onesentence">Footnote 1</title><circle r="3" cx="3" cy="3" fill="white"></circle><circle r="3" cx="15" cy="3" fill="white"></circle><circle r="3" cx="27" cy="3" fill="white"></circle></svg></button></span><sup id="fnref:onesentence" role="doc-noteref" class="footnote-print-only"><a href="#fn:onesentence" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Basically, if your reader sees a wall of text, their brain will activate the evolutionary survival mechanism they have developed to <em>instantly</em> panic-close that tab, before the wall of text jumps out of the page and hecking eats them.</p>

<p><img src="/img/howtoblog/wall_of_text.png" alt="A wall of text-small">
<em>Absolutely no way anyone’s reading this</em></p>

<h3 id="actually-write-the-headings-first">Actually, write the headings first</h3>

<p>This might just be a me thing, but it would be <em>very</em> brave of me to just log on and type. Writing out the headings lets you see if your sections flow on naturally to each other, or if anything’s missing, or if now that you’ve laid the whole thing out before you, this blog post was a mistake, for example.</p>

<h4 id="engage-in-subheadings">Engage in subheadings</h4>

<p>You don’t gotta stop at one heading, you can just keep going and going. And that? That’s value my friend.</p>

<h2 id="you-gotta-make-the-post-interesting-enough-or-people-will-just-get-bored-and-leave">You gotta make the post interesting enough, or people will just get bored and leave?</h2>

<p>You know how you put all that effort into typing those words? What if someone just… didn’t read them? 😬 They can do that, you know. There’s nothing in the rules against it.</p>

<p>The days of having no choice but to read incredibly boring school textbooks to find the information you need to do this hecking history exam are over. You need not hold your reader hostage with boring and irrelevant details, as your textbooks did to you.</p>

<p>You can use uh blogging to break this vicious cycle and usher humanity into a golden age of Content. Nay, you must.</p>

<p>What are they here for? It sure ain’t top text bottom text, I’ll tell ya that for free. It depends on what your post is trying to do. You wanna make the ideas flow on naturally from each other, so there’s no time to get bored and leave. For example:</p>

<p>Somehow you have made it to the point where people are <em>reading</em> your words. This is most of the hard work honestly, you can take it easy from here except that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">h a h a</code> no you can’t. That would risk being inaccessible on main, you see.</p>

<p>You have an idea in your head. <em>You</em> know what you mean with beautiful crystal clarity. But it sucks because you have get that idea in someone <em>else’s</em> head. And the worst part is you have to use <em>words</em> to do it? Buddy, I know how ya feel.</p>

<h2 id="constantly-ask-yourself-does-the-person-reading-this-know-what-the-heck-im-talking-about">Constantly ask yourself: <em>Does</em> the person reading this know what the heck I’m talking about?</h2>

<p>This is the most common thing I say, possibly ever, but definitely when reviewing people’s blog posts.</p>

<p>Obviously, you would not write something that you don’t understand<span class="littlefoot-footnote__host"><button class="littlefoot-footnote__button littlefoot-footnote__button__ellipsis" id="lf-fnref:atme" title="See Footnote 3" aria-expanded="false" data-footnote-button="" data-footnote-id="3" data-footnote-number="3"><svg role="img" aria-labelledby="title-lf-fnref:atme" viewBox="0 0 31 6" preserveAspectRatio="xMidYMid"><title id="title-lf-fnref:atme">Footnote 3</title><circle r="3" cx="3" cy="3" fill="white"></circle><circle r="3" cx="15" cy="3" fill="white"></circle><circle r="3" cx="27" cy="3" fill="white"></circle></svg></button></span><sup id="fnref:atme" role="doc-noteref" class="footnote-print-only"><a href="#fn:atme" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>.

<p>Don’t worry, I just made this one up. There’s nobody out there actually writing this. But do you see how it makes <em>no sense</em>? That’s how you sound to people if you use words they don’t know.</p>

<p>Maybe buzzwords are safe though? No, I’m coming for them too. Buzzwords, if I have understood the meaning correctly, are “words that nobody understands but everyone thinks it’s good to say”. Artificial, and, I cannot stress this enough, Intelligence.</p>

<p>Either expand the acronym the first time you use it, or simply remove it entirely? Can you just explain the concept, rather than using the shorthand or jargon for it?</p>

<p>Hey, does this help you understand what a preposition is?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A preposition is a word or group of words used before a noun, pronoun, or noun phrase to show direction, time, place, location, spatial relationships, or to introduce an object.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, this is what a Terms of Service page would say if they could talk and also we let them write blog posts.</p>

<p>How about:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Prepositions are words like “on,” “in,” “under,” and “beside,”. For example, “The ravioli is <strong>in</strong> the briefcase <strong>behind</strong> you.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes 👏 KING that’s the 👏 stuff 👏 right there.</p>

<h2 id="put-a-summary-at-the-top-maybe">Put a summary at the top maybe?</h2>

<p><img src="/img/howtoblog/tldr_icon.png" alt="Summary Icon|tiny">
<span id="tell-nobody-what-u-saw"></span></p>

<p>You wanna let the reader quickly decide whether to read your post or not. Maybe they get what they wanted <em>just</em> from the summary, and can just stop reading there, <em>instantly</em> winning you a Nobel Peace Prize but for like, blogging.</p>

<p>In the first few sentences, you want the reader to know:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Who is this for?</li>
  <li>What’s going to happen?</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="get-to-the-point">Get to the point</h2>

<p>If you want to say</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“Get someone to review your blog post before you publish it.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then you can just <em>say</em> that<span class="littlefoot-footnote__host"><button class="littlefoot-footnote__button littlefoot-footnote__button__ellipsis" id="lf-fnref:trouble" title="See Footnote 8" aria-expanded="false" data-footnote-button="" data-footnote-id="8" data-footnote-number="8"><svg role="img" aria-labelledby="title-lf-fnref:trouble" viewBox="0 0 31 6" preserveAspectRatio="xMidYMid"><title id="title-lf-fnref:trouble">Footnote 8</title><circle r="3" cx="3" cy="3" fill="white"></circle><circle r="3" cx="15" cy="3" fill="white"></circle><circle r="3" cx="27" cy="3" fill="white"></circle></svg></button></span><sup id="fnref:trouble" role="doc-noteref" class="footnote-print-only"><a href="#fn:trouble" class="footnote" rel="footnote">8</a></sup>.</p>

<p>You don’t have to first say:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“It’s best practice to consider different perspectives. A review by an independent third party can lead to increased success.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What are you trying to <em>tell</em> me? It’s so vague it could mean anything. Who <em>talks</em> like that? When is this post going to get to the bit where we <a href="https://mango.pdf.zone/finding-former-australian-prime-minister-tony-abbotts-passport-number-on-instagram">steal the Prime Minister’s identity on main</a>? One day a long time ago, I guess someone decided you look fancy if you write so vaguely you’re hard to understand. “Maybe they’ll will think I’m hard to understand because I’m so <em>smart</em>”, they thought, with their perfectly smooth and spherical brain.</p>

<h2 id="what-if-you-just-wrote-more-like-how-you-talked">What if you just wrote more like how you talked?</h2>

<p>Bit controversial, but you know how listening to someone explain something usually makes <em>sense</em><span class="littlefoot-footnote__host"><button class="littlefoot-footnote__button littlefoot-footnote__button__ellipsis" id="lf-fnref:well" title="See Footnote 9" aria-expanded="false" data-footnote-button="" data-footnote-id="9" data-footnote-number="9"><svg role="img" aria-labelledby="title-lf-fnref:well" viewBox="0 0 31 6" preserveAspectRatio="xMidYMid"><title id="title-lf-fnref:well">Footnote 9</title><circle r="3" cx="3" cy="3" fill="white"></circle><circle r="3" cx="15" cy="3" fill="white"></circle><circle r="3" cx="27" cy="3" fill="white"></circle></svg></button></span><sup id="fnref:well" role="doc-noteref" class="footnote-print-only"><a href="#fn:well" class="footnote" rel="footnote">9</a></sup>? It’s a lot harder to be completely incoherent when you’re talking, because you can hear yourself. But writing? You can casually write “thusly, delivering more impact” like a serial LinkedIn poster without even noticing. You monster.</p>

<p>So sometimes I try saying what I want to say out loud to myself, alone in my room like a serial LinkedIn poster. Buuuut it often reads better than whatever I had before, thusly delivering more impact.</p>

<h2 id="you-gotta-edit-at-least-once">You <em>gotta</em> edit at least once</h2>

<p>What, you think you’re just going to sit down and type the whole thing in one go, fearlessly hitting “Post” as you type the last full stop?

<p><img src="/img/howtoblog/cut_out_icon.png" alt="Cut bits out|tiny"></p>

<p>You can cut out <em>so much</em> by simply realising “actually, the reader doesn’t care about that.” <em>Simply</em> delete it, and the post loses nothing, so the overall quality goes up. That’s just economics.</p>

You know how when you try on clothes, you get someone else’s opinion before you buy it? How bout you see if your post makes sense before you…. wear it? I’m sorry.</p>

<p>I usually ask reviewers to point out anything:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Hard to understand</li>
  <li>Wrong</li>
  <li>Not necessary</li>
  <li>That doesn’t flow on naturally from the previous bit</li>
</ul>

<p>This process is a <em>lot</em> easier if you use something that lets people highlight text and comment on it, like <a href="https://docs.google.com">Google Docs</a>, but you can continue to email <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">my Blog post (fixed version) (updated) FINAL__FINALFINAL (1).docx</code> or do it in the TikTok comments if you must.</p>

<p>Okay that was the hard part. People are now reading your post, and understanding what you mean, which means you’ve achieved blogging supremacy.

<p>If you are writing something for the audience of “anyone”, you aren’t allowed to assume anything about them.</p>

<p>For example, the wide-ranging “anyone” audience includes toddlers who cannot read, or use a spoon correctly. They will not know what the acronym “FOI” stands for, because they still working on the idea of letters.</p>

<p>It’s possible you can get incredible editorial value by simply realising you do not want to Post at all, or that you actually want to change what you’ve written completely. I rewrote more than half of this post, and it’s <em>still</em> got that bulk-discount fireworks bit in it.</p>
