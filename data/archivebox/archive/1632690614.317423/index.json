                    "\n\n\t\nOn Monday, President Biden met with 10 supposedly moderate Republicans in the Oval Office to discuss their scaled-down $618 billion Covid-relief proposal. Even though the economy is still reeling from the pandemic and tens of millions of Americans are struggling to feed their families and put a roof over their heads, they are very concerned about the $1.9 trillion price tag on Biden\u2019s plan. Lately, it seems, Republicans have taken renewed interest in deficits and our growing national debt. That\u2019s because a Democrat is in the White House.\nWhen a Republican is president, deficits don\u2019t matter. In fact, that means it\u2019s time to cut taxes \u2014 on the wealthy. Republicans\u2019 purported thinking is that tax cuts on high-income earners will incentivize economic growth and thus, as calculated through something called \u201cdynamic scoring,\u201d will produce far more revenue, which in turn more than pays for the tax cuts. This actually never happens. Remember the Laffer Curve? If not \u2014 look in the dictionary under \u201cdiscredited.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nYou may remember that I wrote a book titled Rush Limbaugh Is a Big Fat Idiot and Other Observations. Undertaking the painstaking \u2014 I\u2019m sorry, painful \u2014 research, Rush did make an arguably valid point about the Laffer Curve. \u201cIf you had to pay a 100 percent tax rate on your income, you wouldn\u2019t work!\u201d Of course, Rush was absolutely right. Almost everyone should pay somewhere between 0 percent and 100 percent in order to optimize productive economic activity and everyone\u2019s well-being.\nAnd, yes, out-of-control debt can be an existential threat to a nation. The question becomes: \u201cWhen is it out of control?\u201d To Republicans, the answer is simple: \u201cWhen a Democrat is president.\u201d\nThe record, of course, is almost exactly the opposite. The national debt nearly tripled under Ronald Reagan, who gave huge tax cuts almost exclusively to the top of the income ladder. (In fact, because of a substantial increase in the payroll tax, taxes actually went up for the bottom 40 percent.)\nDuring George H.W. Bush\u2019s single term, the national debt increased by 54 percent. Without a single Republican vote, Bill Clinton increased marginal tax rates for the affluent at the beginning of his two terms. Instead of leading to a recession, as every Republican House and Senate member had predicted, we experienced eight straight years of marked economic growth and a balanced budget with a surplus that George W. Bush inherited.\nDuring his first debate with Al Gore, W. touted his tax-cut proposal: \u201cBy far the vast majority of my tax cut goes to those at the bottom.\u201d Not just \u201ca majority.\u201d Not \u201ca vast majority.\u201d But \u201cby far a vast majority.\u201d Not one of those was true. In fact, the vast majority of the Bush tax cuts went to those at the top. When W. took office, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan endorsed Bush\u2019s tax cut not only as fiscally prudent, but necessary. The looming budget surpluses, Greenspan feared, would pay off the entire federal debt before the end of the decade! If the surpluses didn\u2019t end when our debt was paid off, it could cause serious economic disruption. Large tax cuts, Greenspan said, were necessary to avoid that catastrophe.\nThat particular catastrophe certainly was avoided. By the time George W. Bush handed off the worst economy since the Great Depression to Barack Obama, the national debt had again doubled, and Americans were losing 800,000 jobs a month. I was in a recount at that moment, and Arlen Specter was still a Republican. Which meant that Democrats were two votes short of the 60 needed to stop any Mitch McConnell-led filibuster. Even before Obama had taken his oath of office, McConnell told his caucus that their goal was to make sure that he was a one-term president. To that end, and because of a suddenly revived concern about our national debt, McConnell and his caucus kept rejecting White House stimulus-package proposals.\n\n\nFinally, with three votes from Specter, Susan Collins, and Olympia Snowe, the Senate passed a pared-down $787 billion package that added tax cuts and reduced the Obama plan\u2019s infrastructure spending. Not one House Republican voted for the bill.\nAfter I was finally was sworn in on July 7th, a senior Democratic colleague told me that the Senate was the worse it had ever been. Everyone agreed except Carl Levin of Michigan, who said, \u201cWell, it\u2019s been worse.\u201d\n\u201cWhen?\u201d I asked.\n\u201c1856,\u201d replied Carl.\n\u201cCharles Sumner?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\nIn 1856, abolitionist Sen. Charles Sumner of Massachusetts was savagely \u201ccaned\u201d within an inch of his life by Rep. Preston Brooks of South Carolina.\n Things get worse. \nOf course, things have gotten much worse in the Senate since Carl told me things were somewhat better there than they had been in the lead-up to the Civil War. These days, Republican senators are perfectly willing to undermine Americans\u2019 faith in our democracy.\nIn early 2010, Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles released a detailed plan to reduce the national debt as a percentage of GDP. Simpson-Bowles had some very good things in it \u2014 it would tax capital gains and dividends as ordinary income. It assumed the Bush tax cuts would expire at the end of 2012, and use that as a baseline.* It had some very bad things in it. It would reduce student loans. It would decrease Social Security benefits by tying cost of living adjustments to the Consumer Price Index.\n*\u201cBaseline\u201d takes a bit of explanation. Simpson-Bowles assumed that the Bush tax cuts would expire as scheduled in 2012, and made its computations using the pre-Bush tax rates as a \u201cbaseline.\u201d But the Bush tax cuts were extended during the 2010 lame duck session, and the baseline shifted. As Mitt Romney\u2019s running mate, Paul Ryan would use \u201cbaseline\u201d to get out of any tight spot whenever pressed about his bogus budget numbers. \u201cIt depends on which baseline you use,\u201d was Ryan\u2019s escape hatch. Interviewers knew that any follow-up would elicit a deliberately tedious, time-killing explanation of baselines guaranteed to send their audience elsewhere.\nSimpson-Bowles was also a way for members of Congress to virtue-signal about getting the debt under control. Thing was, we were still in the middle of the worst economic crisis since the worst economic crisis in our history. It didn\u2019t seem to me to be the right time to trim our sails.\n\n\nNevertheless, Republicans, who hated many of its provisions, professed to be Simpson-Bowles supporters. Some Democrats did as well to demonstrate their seriousness about fiscal responsibility. There seemed to be some opportunity here for bipartisanship, and some months later, Mark Warner of Virginia and Lamar Alexander of Tennessee formed a bipartisan group to discuss stuff that we could maybe agree on.\nMark was nice enough to invite me, and I was very happy to go. I genuinely liked a number of my Republican colleagues. My wife, Franni, and I and Tom and Jill Udall would regularly join Republicans Mike and Stephanie Johanns of Nebraska and Mike and Diana Enzi of Wyoming for dinner at one another\u2019s homes. The Enzis and the Frankens threw pizza dinners for each class of Senate pages. Once Diana proudly told the pages that, when she and Mike were back home in Wyoming, they never asked folks whether they were Republicans or Democrats. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to,\u201d I interjected, \u201cthey\u2019re all Republicans.\u201d\nI\u2019m afraid I kind of blew it at the meeting. I noticed right away that my late colleague, Tom Coburn of Oklahoma, was there. Tom, an ob-gyn before he got into politics, was known as \u201cDr. No\u201d because he was the most committed deficit hawk in the Senate and would routinely place a \u201chold\u201d on any bill that would add a dime of new spending.\nAs I listened to the discussion, it began to dawn on me that the Republicans were simply committed to making it impossible for Obama to succeed. Unemployment was still above nine percent. These Republicans had all been cheerleaders for the Bush tax cuts. And none that I could remember had said a peep in 2004 when former Treasury Secretary Paul O\u2019Neill revealed that Dick Cheney had informed him that \u201cdeficits don\u2019t matter.\u201d\nAs with many such things in the Senate, the meeting wasn\u2019t really on the level. Or so it seemed to me. It did occur to me later that I hadn\u2019t needed to share that with all of them. I wasn\u2019t invited back.\nAfter Republicans flipped the House in 2010, everything became increasingly difficult. In 2011, House Republicans put a gun to the collective noggin of the Democratic Senate and President Obama by threatening to default on our debt by refusing to raise the debt ceiling. At the 11th hour, Democrats agreed to what became known as \u201csequestration,\u201d which mandated about $100 billion in cuts annually, almost all in discretionary spending.\n\n\nMy Republican colleagues were shocked when Obama won re-election. The economy continued to recover, and when Donald Trump took the oath of office for his first and only term as chief executive, he inherited 76 straight months of economic growth.\nAnd worse.\nLike W., Trump campaigned promising a tax cut geared to low- and middle-income Americans. And like Bush, he was bullshitting.\nDuring the floor debate on the Republicans\u2019 2017 tax cut, I approached Tim Scott of South Carolina, their floor manager for the bill. \u201cYou know, this is going to explode the deficit.\u201d\nTim told me it wouldn\u2019t because of \u2014 wait for it \u2014 dynamic scoring.\n\u201cNo,\u201d I insisted. \u201cYour own Congressional Budget Office says it will create another $1.9 trillion in debt.\u201d The CBO is the nonpartisan agency that provides Congress with budget and economic research. I used \u201cyour own\u201d CBO because, holding majorities in both the House and Senate, Republicans had chosen the CBO director. And when the CBO \u201cscored\u201d the Republican tax cut, it estimated that it would add $1.9 trillion to our national debt.\nI\u2019d previously had just enough conversations with Tim to know a few things. Despite all historical evidence to the contrary, he really did believe that this new tax cut would pay itself. But even if it didn\u2019t, that would be OK with him. Not that he liked federal debt. But it did serve as a great excuse to impose severe limits on spending. You see, Tim is of the Grover Norquist \u201cI want to reduce the size of government to where I can drag it into the bathroom and drown it in the bathtub\u201d variety.\nDuring one of our discussions on the floor, Tim even told me that he didn\u2019t believe that government created any jobs. Forgetting for the moment that both of us had government jobs, I mentioned the Erie Canal. Also, rural electrification. And the transcontinental railroad. Oh, and how \u2018bout the interstate highway system? The space program. (I knew Tim enjoyed watching live sports carried by satellite.) And the internet (formerly known as the Internet).\nCleverly, right there on his feet, Tim revised his economic thesis to an equally ridiculous claim \u2014 that the government doesn\u2019t create any net jobs. You see, government investment in each of the things I\u2018d mentioned could have been replaced by far more efficient private investment. Who knows? Maybe we\u2019d have landed a man on the moon during the Roaring Twenties! How great would it have been to see astronauts dance the Charleston at zero gravity?!\n\n\nAs it would turn out, the enormous tax cut had, at first, some stimulative effect. The private sector invested some of its newfound tax savings on capital equipment, hiring, and even some modest increases in wages \u2014 mostly one-time bonuses. But mainly, corporate America was using its windfall, as predicted, on stock buybacks. The market continued to shoot up, which was particularly good news for the 10 percent of Americans who own north of 80 percent of all stock-market wealth.\nAs for national debt? By October 2019, before the coronavirus pandemic was something Trump could not even dream of bungling, the CBO projected the U.S. deficit for the year to hit $984 billion, almost $300 billion more than the CBO had predicted prior to the 2017 Tax Cut and Jobs Act. Meanwhile, job growth in the first three years of the Trump administration was proceeding at a slower pace than it had during the previous three years of the Obama administration.\nAnd then came 2020.\nThe United States entered the decade last among developed nations in income and wealth inequality. Or, I guess, first. By far!\nFor the moment, let\u2019s put aside Trump\u2019s criminally negligent handling of the coronavirus. Oh, let\u2019s not.\nIn the past, the United States would have led a global effort to fight a global pandemic. During the 2014 Ebola crisis, the CDC was the first to identify what was happening in Liberia. The CDC moved in. Our military put up hospitals, and our public-health and medical professionals led a truly global effort to treat the sick and dying and successfully contained the outbreak to West Africa. In the end, two Americans died of Ebola.\nIn contrast, when Covid hit the United States, Trump punted responsibility to the states. It\u2019s as if FDR had said after Pearl Harbor, \u201cThis is pretty much Hawaii\u2019s problem.\u201d\nBy March, Congress and the White House had agreed to a $2 trillion package to help Americans through the pandemic. Individuals earning less than $75,000 a year would receive a check for $1,200. There was $250 billion to add an additional $600 weekly to unemployment checks. $150 billion for state and local governments, and $130 billion for hospitals. In April, there was an additional $484 billion for the Paycheck Protection Program, and $75 billion more for hospitals and a woefully underfunded, terribly administered testing program.\n\n\nInexplicably, $70.3 billion would go to real estate investors in the form of restored tax breaks. Nearly 82 percent of those benefitting would receive $1 million or more, according to the House and Senate\u2019s nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation.\nSo much for Congress\u2019 laser focus on making sure low- and middle-income Americans could make it through the pandemic.\nFortunately, Trump told us, Covid would be all over by Easter, and urged Americans to celebrate the Resurrection by crowding into church pews around the nation.\nBy July 22nd, after the numbers of American dead from Covid had reached nearly 150,000, a Texas senator named Ted Cruz let everyone know that the whole thing was a big hoax:\n\u201cI guarantee you the week after the election, suddenly all those Democratic governors, all those Democratic mayors, will say, \u2018Everything\u2019s magically better. Go back to work. Go back to school. Suddenly all the problems are solved.\u2019 You won\u2019t have to wait for Biden to be sworn in. All they\u2019ll need is Election Day and suddenly their willingness to just destroy people\u2019s lives and livelihoods, they will have accomplished their task.\u201d\nTo Cruz\u2019s credit, three days after the election, he apologized and humbly asked for forgiveness.\nNo. Wait. I\u2019m wrong.\nThank God for my fact-checker.\nAnd still worse.\nUnlike Trump and Cruz, Democrats in Congress had been paying attention to science and scientists and understood that the coronavirus pandemic would continue to infect and kill a staggering number of Americans and continue to economically devastate tens of millions of families through no fault of their own. On May 15th, the Democratic House passed a second $2 trillion Covid-relief package to help them through the months ahead.\nBut Senate Republicans and the Trump White House refused to act.\nThe growing economic disparities of the past four decades exploded in 2020 \u2014 the fault of nobody. Except Donald Trump and everyone who blindly followed his lead.\nThis includes every Republican in Congress.\nEven as he gave his rambling farewell speech to a small gathering at Andrews Air Force Base, Trump felt the need to brag about the stock market\u2019s record highs, omitting the fact that by far the vast majority of the benefit was going to those at the top.\n\n\nAmericans at the bottom end have not fared so well. Especially black and brown ones. If one suspected that the death rates from Covid-19 might reflect this country\u2019s profound economic and health disparities by race and ethnicity, one would be correct.\nBlack Americans continue to die of Covid at about twice the rate of white Americans. Native Americans and Latinos are also dying at highly disproportionate rates compared to whites. That said, as of this writing, just more than 200,000 white Americans have died of Covid. The United States has four percent of the world\u2019s population and, approximately, 20 percent of its coronavirus fatalities.\nFrance, Germany, Denmark, Britain, and other developed countries decided to take over the payrolls of struggling companies, paying workers to stay home in order to slow the spread of the virus while averting the kind of economic uncertainty and hardship so many Americans have experienced. While other developed nations made sure to carry their citizens throughout this once-in-a-century calamity, food insecurity has tripled in the United States.\nBut then again, there\u2019s the S&P 500.\nOnly after it had become clear that control of the U.S. Senate would depend on the outcome of the Georgia runoffs, Republicans finally saw the wisdom of a relief package to help Americans struggling to feed their families and keep a roof over their heads. Not too generous, though. While many professed to believe that the election had been stolen, the non-crazy ones knew that Biden would be the next president. Let\u2019s not get carried away with helping people. Just enough to win the two Georgia seats. Yeah! That\u2019s a good plan!\nThe repair that is long overdue:\nTax fairness, investment in human capital and infrastructure, reforms in labor law and in our electoral process, childcare, racial justice, and a return of some sense of respect and fair play. (See Merrick Garland and Amy Coney Barrett.)\nAnd, oh, yes, tackling Covid with the urgency, resources, and professionalism we should have been applying all along.\nAnd \u2026 help. Help for folks, who through no fault of their own, have been devastated financially.\nBetter?\nThis will take \u2014 dare I say \u2014 money. $1.9 trillion is what President Biden is asking for. And it is what Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, former chair of the Council of Economic Advisors and the Federal Reserve, believes is necessary to fight Covid, provide relief for the American people, and make the long-term investments that will help grow our economy. It\u2019s kind of the thing Democrats have tended to do in the past 60 years or so.\n\n\nThat\u2019s why, since 1962, GDP growth has been 75 percent higher under Democratic presidents than under Republican presidents \u2014 and business-investment growth 126 percent higher, and unemployment 17.5 percent lower. And average weekly earnings have been positive under Democratic presidents and negative under Republicans.\nNine-hundred thousand Americans applied for unemployment benefits last month. What Biden and Yellen are proposing seems to be a much saner use of $1.9 trillion than tax cuts for those at the top that came during a three-year-plus run of job growth inherited from Obama.\nElections have consequences. Biden was elected president. And Democrats control both houses of Congress. Barely. And Mitch McConnell will almost certainly still have the filibuster. And during the Obama administration, he used the filibuster more than it had been used previously in the entire history of the country.\nI don\u2019t want to say Mitch is cynical, but the final sticking point of the latest Covid-relief bill was the size of Elaine Chao\u2019s tax cut. That\u2019s how bad it is!\nAdmittedly, Mitch\u2019s actions on behalf of his caucus and all fiscally responsible Americans will be based on principle. The principle that lower marginal tax rates on the wealthy more than pay for themselves and create prosperity for working folks and the poor. It\u2019s worked for 60 years!
