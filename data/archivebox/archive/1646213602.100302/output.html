      <p>I picked up James C. Scott’s <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seeing_Like_a_State">Seeing Like a State</a></em> recently and, while I haven’t gotten too deep into it yet, I found its ideas of <em>social legibility</em> particularly interesting. The author argues that states must make their societies <em>legible</em> in order to more efficiently control, tax, and more broadly impose their will upon individuals. Legibility can manifest itself in many ways: a census, tax returns, even city grids (as opposed to the organic and chaotic street layouts found in older cities). This legibility can be used for good or bad: to control the population or to more efficiently create social programs to benefit people.</p>

<p>Since learning about this idea I keep thinking about how it applies to our digital lives. As people’s online interactions have shifted towards centralized platforms: Instagram, Google, Twitter, TikTok, Reddit, etc., they have become increasingly <em>legible</em> and, if you buy the arguments of <em>Seeing Like a State</em>, more control-able.</p>

<p>More than enough has been written about the implications of these giant platforms controlling and monitoring our lives. One thing I haven’t read much of is how states and companies’ reliance on social legibility can be used as a tool against them.  It seems like there are a variety of simple acts that can throw a wrench into the legibility of one’s digital life in a meaningful way. A few examples off of the top of my head:<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<ul>
  <li>Using uBlock or running a pi hole on your local network to block tracking scripts and ads.</li>
  <li>Using Linux instead of MacOS or Windows.</li>
  <li>Hosting communities on platforms like <a href="https://joinmastodon.org/">Mastodon</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat">IRC</a>, or <a href="https://matrix.org/">Matrix</a>.</li>
  <li>Using an alternative frontend to social networks like <a href="https://github.com/iv-org/invidious">Invidious</a> (YouTube), <a href="https://github.com/zedeus/nitter">Nitter</a> (Twitter) or <a href="https://codeberg.org/teddit/teddit">Teddit</a> (Reddit).<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></li>
  <li>Publishing on your own website, especially if you use a protocol like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemini_(protocol)">Gemini</a> (a simplified HTTP alternative).</li>
</ul>

<p>I’ve been exploring a lot of these alternative digital spaces lately, mostly for the fun of it all and the wholesome communities I’ve found around them. From reading <em>Seeing Like a State</em> I’m realizing that these also function as a form of resistance against the hyper-commercialized internet I find myself regularly frustrated by.</p>

<p>Thinking about it- I’ve also realized how effective being an outlier in data can be. I frequently work with large datasets and know how frustrating it is to find oddities and outliers. Many times I simply remove these points in order to keep my abstractions simpler and easier to understand!</p>

<p>My hope is that by finding these small ways of increasing my <em>illegibility</em>, I can ensure the breadcrumbs of my digital life can be outliers- on the fringes of the norm. The hope is that these fringes aren’t worth it for large companies to attempt to normalize, commercialize, or control. It’s a small yet somehow satisfying form of personal resistance.</p>
