Here are some of the things I worked on in the last 2 years.</p><ul><li>In a small team (averaging ~3 people, I think?) in a little under a year, we built a SQL query planner that passed the &gt;6 million tests in the <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/sqllogictest/doc/trunk/about.wiki">sqlite logic test suite</a>.</li><li>I figured out how to <a href="https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/materialize-decorrelation">decorrelate arbitrary SQL subqueries</a> (I wasn't the first person to figure this out, but I got there independently).</li><li>I demonstrated <a href="https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/internal-consistency-in-streaming-systems/">a mode of consistency failure</a> in various popular streaming systems that I believe was not widely understood at the time.</li><li>I wrote <a href="https://github.com/jamii/focus">the text editor</a> that I use for coding and writing every day. It took on the order of 100 hours of work.</li></ul><p>It's hard to write these examples without sounding like I'm bragging, but to be very clear - I don't think that these projects are particularly impressive in context. They are the kind of projects that someone with a decade of experience in a specialized area should be capable of.</p><p>But they are also projects that I'm fairly confident I would have failed at even 5 years ago.</p><p>My ability now isn't due to any intrinsic talent or grand insight but instead hundreds of tiny changes in habits, processes and values. When I compare these changes to online writing and discussions about how to get better at programming, I see very little overlap. The changes that lead to me being more effective are either not talked about at all or are in direct opposition to popular advice.</p><p>I'm hesitant to write these kinds of posts, because they veer awfully close to flamebait and I really prefer to write things that are strongly factual rather than opinion-based. But there are a lot of things that I wish I could go back in time and tell my younger self, and the situation hasn't gotten much better since. There is a lot of high-quality writing aimed at people who are just learning to program, but very little that helped me figure out how to progress from being a novice.</p><p>When I started reflecting on what has and hasn't worked for me I found a <em>lot</em> of things that I wanted to write down, so I've tried to roughly organize it:</p><ul><li><a href="https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/on-bad-advice/">On bad advice</a></li><li><a href="https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/things-unlearned">Things unlearned</a></li><li>Eyes on the goal</li><li>Emotional management</li><li>Speed matters</li><li>Being faster</li><li>Architecture</li><li>Testing</li><li>Writing</li><li>On talent and expertise</li><li>Mistakes and gaps</li></ul></article><footer><div>Questions?
