                    "\n        This month, guest contributor Rob Alderson questions the trend to dismiss the word \u2018Content\u2019.\nOn Monday, The Guardian published its list of the 100 most influential people working in the media today. The top three were Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg, Google\u2019s Larry Page and Apple\u2019s Tim Cook (fourth, if you\u2019re interested, was smugness\u2019 George Osborne).\nLists like this are by their very nature subjective, but even so there was broad agreement with The Guardian\u2019s top three, although things became much less consensual as you went down the list.\nBut regardless of which Jeremy \u2013 Corbyn or Clarkson \u2013 should have ranked higher, the list underlined once again the ways in which the media landscape has changed, and a key part of this change has been the apparently unassailable rise of content \u2013 as a thing, as an idea and as a buzzword.\nThe backlash has been building for a while. For some people, the word itself is the problem. Content, they maintain is a reductive way of thinking about editorial and creative output. Greg Satell summed this up well on Harvard Business Review where he wrote: \u201cWe never call anything that\u2019s good \u2018content.\u2019 Nobody walks out of a movie they loved and says, \u2018Wow!  What great content!\u2019 Nobody listens to \u2018content\u2019 on their way to work in the morning. Do you think anybody ever called Ernest Hemingway a \u2018content creator\u2019? If they did, I bet he would punch \u2018em in the nose.\u201d\nAs much as I like the idea of Old Papa Hemingway becoming the lodestar for modern-decision making (we could have What Would Ernest Do? bracelets), this is an odd argument. I don\u2019t love the word but it\u2019s a useful catch-all term to describe what a lot of us do. I don\u2019t find goulash a particularly pleasant word, but I enjoy a Hungarian stew as much as the next person. Also, nobody is suggesting that it\u2019s replacing words like music and film, or that content creator will replace writer or author.\nIn a widely-shared blog post, Dave Trott launched his attack on content from a different and altogether more interesting direction. He recalled being part of a panel discussing content and being frustrated/amazed that nobody could really say what it meant.\n\u201cNo-one defined it because, to everyone else, it didn\u2019t seem important to define it; it just seemed important to say it a lot,\u201d he writes. \u201cGradually, I began to get the idea that what content actually is wasn\u2019t important at all. Content is seen as just stuff. The stuff that goes into the space that\u2019s there to be filled.\u201d He argued that this dimly-defined idea of content now plays second fiddle to the ways by which it is delivered; his analogy was that the lorry had become more important than its cargo, which he sees as a fundamental shift.\nIn the magazine world, this discussion has been largely ignored. I get the impression it\u2019s seen as a debate for marketing conferences rather than editorial teams, for The Drum rather than magCulture. Content, as a term, is rather sneered at. But increasingly it seems this one is for us as well.\nAt magCulture\u2019s Modern Magazine conference, the focus was very much on \u201cbrand extensions\u201d (yes I know you\u2019re cringing again) and ways in which independent titles were experimenting with different platforms, different ways of telling the different stories and interacting with readers. Monocle has its radio station. Mushpit has a political party. Mondial encourages its readers to undertake a mid-winter bike ride. The Gourmand held a fashion show for dogs.\nIn November, The New York Times Magazine collaborated with Google Cardboard on a virtual reality device to screen its film The Displaced about four young people whose lives were decimated by war. I interviewed its photography director Kathy Ryan a couple of weeks before it was released and her excitement for the project was genuine and palpable. This wasn\u2019t a \u201cproper print\u201d person railroaded into producing digital content by some be-trilbied audience engagement team, this was a senior creative at one of the world\u2019s most famous magazines babbling in delight at this new outlet.\nThe danger with dismissing content as a word is that we also dismiss it as an idea. All of us who love magazines love that irreplaceable physical experience; holding, tearing, smelling, bookmarking, archiving; poring over. Sharing, not through a handily-placed Twitter button, but by carting a bagful of treasured issues over to a friend\u2019s house and explaining IN GREAT DETAIL why what you\u2019re about to show them is so special.\nBut times have changed and three tech geeks can now be named the three most influential people in the media without so much as a shrug. We need a new way of talking and thinking about what we do, and it seems that content will do just fine. The term might be limited but the things we can do in its name are anything but, whatever Hemingway might say.\n\n      "
