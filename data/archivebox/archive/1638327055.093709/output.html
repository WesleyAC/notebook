I have been fascinated for a long time about how fundamentally confusing it is to think about any of this stuff, because it's so obvious everyone who disagrees, disagrees about what the basics of reality are. I don't think it's right to describe what's going on here as a new form of tulip mania, because ordinary bubbles—the tulips, or South Sea shares, or 19thC railways, or dot coms—are errors of judging value, when lots of people think a thing is much more valuable than it has any right to be. The disagreement is just about price.<br>
<br>
What's going on here with NFTs, and other ideas that claim to substitute for money or currency or for value itself, is a deeper disagreement about what <em>value</em> is, about criticising the human metaphor of cash-as-a-store and money-as-medium, as though treating money as a programmable object could endow it with even more magical properties than it ordinarily has; which is far weirder, and from my point of view, wronger.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/68398" target="_self">Fiasco da Gama</a> at <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/193313/The-Billion-Dollar-Torrent#8171908" target="_self">6:55 PM</a>  on November 18 [<a href="https://www.metafilter.com/favorited/2/8171908" style="font-weight:normal;" title="67 users marked this as favorite">67 favorites</a>] </span></div><br><br>

So this is where it gets very interesting and where you get paradox after paradox. That's one interpretation of fiat currencies, that they're valuable because States create and support them as means of paying taxes and providing services; but there's more to them—it's very well known that people on opposite sides of wars can, and do, trade with each other <em>in those same currencies</em>; even if it's against the law and condemned by everyone, the notes have value because people agree that they do, and without any more reason than that. <br>
<br>
Cash has a use that tends to escape the use of power, as <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/548412/the-money-plot-by-frederick-kaufman/">Kaufman's recent book</a> suggests, it's because it's a metaphor, not a thing at all. The interesting thing about cryptographic substitutes is they start in the other direction: with attempting to escape the use of power, and with lots of bold claims about solving social problems, but because they're a technology not a metaphor, they just haven't so far, ever worked very well.<br>
<br>
It's easy-to-use, widely-recognised registries of ownership, in another paradox, that really do exist now, in almost every kind of society and political system, in formal provenance registers for actual artworks, but even more in the form of land title; they're hundreds of years old, they work very reliably, and there's a world of very well-tested infrastructures of regulation and law around them. They don't depend on anyone caring how much a parcel of land costs, they're purely a very long ledger of numbers referring to space and the owners.<br>
<br>
But to keep going: in my colonial country this was a thing that was established only at gunpoint and supported only through ultimate power of the State. It's Aboriginal people who quite fairly say, the British just made the whole thing up, and critique the whole arrangement as an absurd, environmentally harmful, scam.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/68398" target="_self">Fiasco da Gama</a> at <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/193313/The-Billion-Dollar-Torrent#8171942" target="_self">9:43 PM</a>  on November 18 [<a href="https://www.metafilter.com/favorited/2/8171942" style="font-weight:normal;" title="22 users marked this as favorite">22 favorites</a>] </span></div><br><br>

<br>
Fundamentally, any currency lives and dies by the trust we collectively hold in its value.  Meaning, I know that the currency you give me today will be happily accepted by someone else tomorrow.  That’s it.  No money has any underlying value beyond we all agree it does.<br>
<br>
This is the fundamental insight of the crypto bros — there is nothing stopping any group of people from collectively deciding what is valuable. That’s why Beanie Babies were so damned popular in the late 90s; a group of crazed collectors said so.<br>
<br>
They forget, however, that those folks with guns and bombs (more accurately, the people who <em>control</em> the folks with guns and bombs) perform an important function by stabilizing  expectations and keeping the scammers (somewhat) at bay.  Their job is to make the currency stable and predictable, so you and I won’t have any trouble getting spending our currency tomorrow.<br>
<br>
In cryptocurrency, the only thing performing that function is the invisible hand of the market, which, I’m sure you know those problems so I won’t rehash them here.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/252859" target="_self">Big Al 8000</a> at <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/193313/The-Billion-Dollar-Torrent#8171943" target="_self">9:45 PM</a>  on November 18 [<a href="https://www.metafilter.com/favorited/2/8171943" style="font-weight:normal;" title="10 users marked this as favorite">10 favorites</a>] </span></div><br><br>

There is a set number of phrases they reply with to any criticism, but at the same time never manage to follow up with anything like data or facts. There are a number of set sentences that they utter almost mechanically. "Proof of stake" is one of them. The standard libertarian "freedom from government regulation" is another. It's like they believe that uttering "proof of stake" and similar are like magic spells which automatically dispel any doubt.

<br>
For some perspective the entire indexed catalog for Napster at it's prime before shutdown was something on the order of 10 TB, and Soulseek at it's peak and prime was something like 15 TB.<br>
<br>
15-20 TB of mostly automated script generated magic internet NFT collectible trading cards is a fuckton of... well, whatever that is.<br>
<br>
It's like the cryptobros heard everyone else ranting at them "Hey, you don't seem to remember the Dutch Tulip craze do you?" and they replied with "Wait, you mean like this?" and created NFTs and everyone else went "Oh god damn it no what the fuck!"<br>
<br>
Well, as horrible as this is it's been fun watching NFT buyers/traders get cluelessly bent out of shape and salty when someone right clicks on their super rare NFT they posted as a twitter profile picture and reposting it all over the place.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/17349" target="_self">loquacious</a> at <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/193313/The-Billion-Dollar-Torrent#8171966" target="_self">12:52 AM</a>  on November 19 [<a href="https://www.metafilter.com/favorited/2/8171966" style="font-weight:normal;" title="8 users marked this as favorite">8 favorites</a>] </span></div><br><br> 
		<a name="8171970"></a><div class="comments">We have spent so long comparing NFTs to the Star Registry, to highlight the technical flaws in the very model.  We thought that if we just showed the folly in the approach, it could prevent a disaster.<br>
<br>
But no, this is not a simple vanity purchase of unfulfillable promises.  This is a pyramid scheme backed by some of the most powerful people; and it works because we've been through a pretty shocking shift in how we thought about the value of a lot of information, like music and movies and news.  People who felt left behind by the sudden death of newspapers and record shops and bookstores, thrilled and blindsided by the wealth of media we now drown in, feel like there has to be some way to get a step <em>ahead</em> of this for next time. <br>
<br>
We saw the same thing in the 1920s: people who'd been through The Great War and The Influenza and Jazz came through with some funny lessons, one of which was "buy war bonds".  You could spend money to "invest" in someone's growing business on the stock market, and now that War Is Over we can finally get on the Ploughshares Forever Economy.  We all know how that ended: people went into debt, buying stock on margin, and purchasing groups drove up prices in pump-and-dump scams.  <br>
<br>
The difference is that this time there's no underlying narrative of an actual economy growing food or building appliances or anything.  You hear people use the phrase "creating wealth" to describe speculating on the purest forms of abstraction.  It feels like hubris to call this Peak Financialisation because I am absolutely certain we'll do it even worse next time. After all, even Ponzi's scheme was nominally about cashing in on arbitrage flaws in the international postal system rather than any actual industry.<br>
<br>
So as with Amway or Scientology or any other pyramid structure, we're going to see a lot of debt-driven human suffering come out of this.  We mock the crypto bros now, and it does feel satisfying to see a self-important white boy lose his shirt sometimes, but they will find those Greater Fools to buy their pointless "assets" on margin.  What happens when local governments realise that their pension funds were all invested in Magic Beans again?  How many OAPs will suddenly find themselves without the P?<br>
<br>
And mark my words, with the amount of money keeping these eggshells inflated, the billionaires will not settle for any of <em>their</em> kind holding any sort of bag.  They will ensure these things get dumped on all of the rest of us before the entire edifice crumbles.<br>

You can verify ownership of my house online right now by looking it up in my city's property tax database.  If you want to make it fancier, I guess the database entry could include a copy of the deed signed by a city certificate.  What would a blockchain add to that?<br>

I don't think this is the same thing. I haven't really verified your ownership till I go to town hall. Like, if you want to take out a loan on equity on your home, the bank isn't going to go to your town's plotviewer and trusting it during underwriting. The blockchain is instantly verifiable anywhere though, meaning that everything becomes truly digital. <br>
<br>

Sure, <a href="https://usa.visa.com/solutions/crypto.html">straight from the horse's mouth</a>. As I understand it, VISA is already implementing blockchain technology to move money between banks. That is what millions of people are doing everyday when they send remittances homes to their relatives in Central America and other parts of the third world, without going through Western Union or the traditional banking structure and paying their pound of flesh (and this can be done via proof of stake today). I don't know enough about VISA to know if your individual card swipes ever get on a blockchain, but I suspect it is a matter of time. <br>

Crypto and blockchain technology are being massively adopted in the way the internet was in the mid 90s.

But as I see it, as energy consumption on the planet increases as an inevitable result of growth in all domains, we are going to be forced by hook or by crook to find ways to increase our use of renewable energy sources.

All of those things are issued by a central authority and only have meaning because they're guaranteed and enforced by that same central authority. So the arguments for putting them into a distributed-authority database are what again?<br>
<br>
You'll still need a central real-world authority to verify the stuff getting put onto the blockchain and to compare against what's coming out of the blockchain, lest Crazy Bob's Quitclaim Service starts randomly issuing duplicate and conflicting titles for property. So at that point, the whole blockchain-as-public-ledger becomes kind of redundant and pointless, so why bother duplicating the effort of having that central authority maintain their own database?<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/146431" target="_self">RonButNotStupid</a> at <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/193313/The-Billion-Dollar-Torrent#8172017" target="_self">6:49 AM</a>  on November 19 [<a href="https://www.metafilter.com/favorited/2/8172017" style="font-weight:normal;" title="18 users marked this as favorite">18 favorites</a>] </span></div><br><br>

All of the documents in question would still be issued by and subject to the same regulatory authorities, but instead of carrying around a piece of potentially forgeable plastic or paper to demonstrate my legal right to whatever boat I claim to own or car I claim to be able to drive, anyone anywhere can instantly check to see if that document is legitimate if it is on a blockchain. <br>

And how are you going to do that?<br>
<br>
I'm not talking about the blockchain recognizing the legitimacy of a particular transaction, I'm talking about an two separately minted NFTs representing two different titles purporting to be attached to the same property: the "real" one, and a duplicate. <br>
<br>
Who regulates the issuance of new NFTs representing property? If only new NFTs can be created by a central authority, why do we need the blockchain to begin with?<br>
<br>
If anyone can issue an NFT which purports to be attached to any real-world piece of property, how do you pick the "real" one on the blockchain without consulting a central authority? If you have to cross reference an NFT against a central authority's database to determine if it's the "true" NFT for a piece of property, why bother having a redundant ledger in the blockchain, since both the database of the central authority and the blockchain will have to be updated whenever something is transacted.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/146431" target="_self">RonButNotStupid</a> at <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/193313/The-Billion-Dollar-Torrent#8172025" target="_self">7:13 AM</a>  on November 19 [<a href="https://www.metafilter.com/favorited/2/8172025" style="font-weight:normal;" title="10 users marked this as favorite">10 favorites</a>] </span></div><br><br>

I'll just address the very last comment about massive adoption: I've already mentioned a practical application of cryptocurrency in this thread; I appreciate the comment about property deeds. <br>
<br>
I don't know enough about blockchain or cryptocurrency to contribute anything more than what I have already said, but I want to reiterate my original point about the quality of the discussion in this thread. Since my original post, several contentless posts have been made that literally contribute more to global warming than my own involvement with NFTs.  Many people like myself come here for informed discussion on topics that are relevant to our lives, we hope and expect to learn more.  The whole cryptoindustry has a market cap equivalent to that of silver, and is rapidly changing entire economies and the global financial system. To come here and see it dismissed as a ponzi scheme is disappointing.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/242463" target="_self">os tuberoes</a> at <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/193313/The-Billion-Dollar-Torrent#8172038" target="_self">7:31 AM</a>  on November 19 </span></div><br><br>

This is an incredibly common response in these discussions -- basically the first step in a sort of script that this poster also seems to be following; I see it all the time on twitter for anyone who is foolish enough to make a skeptical post about crypto without limiting replies. But also is something that remains completely unmaterialized, everyone is always promising concrete applications and they never show. (One next step after this is pointed out is to start talking about "web3", although there's some branching in the script here.) I wonder where this script comes from?<br>
<br>
<i>A lot of you also don't seem to know that some of your financial transactions are almost surely ALREADY on a blockchain, whether you own any crypto or not; major credit cards are involved in blockchain technology. </i><br>
<br>
This is laughably false; I'm sure that private key cryptography is involved in some of my transactions, but there is 0% chance that any of my real money is converted into crypto and back on the path of any transaction, this would make no sense for them to be doing. Visa is involved in crypto, but from any concrete information I can find (including what was linked from visa in this thread if you read it with clear eyes) it's one-way transactions <i>out</i> of crypto, and the scale is miniscule compared to real money. There's tons of reporting about this, but here's an oldish article that isn't particularly skeptical but gives concrete numbers and descriptions of services without some of the marketing language: <a href="https://fortune.com/2021/07/15/visa-crypto-payments-fintech-cryptocurrency/">https://fortune.com/2021/07/15/visa-crypto-payments-fintech-cryptocurrency/</a>.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/15596" target="_self">advil</a> at <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/193313/The-Billion-Dollar-Torrent#8172041" target="_self">7:34 AM</a>  on November 19 [<a href="https://www.metafilter.com/favorited/2/8172041" style="font-weight:normal;" title="8 users marked this as favorite">8 favorites</a>] </span></div><br><br>

Yes, other PoS systems can host NFTs right now, but they aren't very popular. NFTs are pointers to something else and nothing more. If you've been on the net long enough and bookmarked things you like, you know how often things on the net just disappear. NFT is just a way to put a friendly easy to understandable face on technology that you wouldn't normally understand. So, it brings in more people. Flavored vaping. I think it was extremely irresponsible for auction houses to participate in NFTs when they had to know exactly what they were and were not. But, I was flipping around and landed on CNBC and they were discussing this quarters growth being largely in auction houses. They then joked with each other about what each had bought at auction--nothing.<br>
<br>
Blockchains are useful and will be applied in useful places. That doesn't mean those applications have to have anything to do with cryptocurrencies.<br>
<br>
Cryptocurrencies are indeed useful, and a quickly evolving technology. But, innovation is not in bitcoin or ethereum (though of course things are built on top of it that are interesting). They're too popular to innovate because change annoys people.<br>
<br>
This NFTBay is genius. I love the question of whether what the actual value of what it 'pirates' is. I own cryptocurrencies, I think they are interesting, I understand what they are from a technical viewpoint, and I completely think NFT is exploitative and without any long lasting value. I'm sure I'm wrong, but I don't invest in things I do not understand or ethically support.<br>
<br>
I hate that this kind of thing is just going to bring regulation until it isn't interesting at all anymore. But, you have people like Elon Musk obviously manipulating the price of things on twitter, the USDT drama, and well... that also makes me understand why regulation might be necessary.

This is...completely unresponsive to my questions, and the fact that you can't explain here what you think is in fact explainable in a five-minute primer does rather suggest to me that you can't answer them.

Personally, I would be happy to see widespread actual useful applications for blockchain.  Why not?

This wasn't meant to be patronizing, but what I know about blockchain is enough to suggest to me that your questions aren't really even answerable: the basic function of a blockchain is that its validated by everyone on the blockchain, and there is no way for a putative RandomBigEvilMegaCorp to have an independent vote on your ownership, unless they acquire 51% of the coins, at which point everyone abandons the chain (I believe there are real-world cases of this happening). This isn't very likely for the largest currencies, since they have "market caps" larger than most corporations. I apologize for the suggested insult, I shouldn't have said that the way I did. <br>
<br>
<em>But to me it still looks like just "interesting, probably worth a few people studying"--and with the level hype so far beyond that, I think it's totally reasonable that people are worrying about that disconnect causing real harm to ordinary people.</em> I couldn't agree more with this. I first started to think seriously about crypto when El Salvador adopted bitcoin as a co-official currency; looking a little at, uh, the "cryptospace", it is a bewildering place, with people desperate to strike gold and plenty of people willing to sell them a pick-ax. It feels like the Wild West. <br>
<br>
What I initially wanted to object to is how in this forum, which is a place for sophisticated discussion, the entire concept is dismissed almost gleefully as a scam or pyramid scheme while so much institutional money moves into the domain and an entire country adopts bitcoin as a co-official currency. Despite claims here, blockchain technology and cryptocurrency have an ever-increasing scope of practical applications (remittances are an obvious case but there are others). It reminds of the mid 90s when some people dismissed the internet. <br>
<br>
Suggesting that this conversation is interesting (for example, how crypto will or will not be used in the future, its possible even if unrealized practical applications, what the consequences of proof-of-work are and other legitimate criticisms that can be leveled against yet another capitalist hydra-head, our own patterns of consumption in a capitalist society) and we should take some of this stuff seriously draws browbeating.

<br>
To try to put some info directly into the thread:<br>
<br>
Proof of work is inherently energy consumptive. Energy consumption is the thing that makes it difficult to control. The thing that prevents one actor from controlling the currency is that no one has as much hardware and consumes as much energy as the rest. This also means, if it declines significantly, then people left holding the bag are really screwed, because if it becomes a situation where just one holdout has more mining equipment *currently in operation* than the rest of the world then they suddenly have all the marbles, marbles that could be worth a lot more than the ones they directly own.<br>
<br>
But the problems with the alternative, proof of stake, are also fairly significant. In that, control by a single actor is prevented by the fact that it's unlikely that any single person owns more than 50% of the currency. Not only is that a lot more likely to happen, say like if one extremely rich person goes and buys a lot up, there's also if multiple entities pool their resources. It's another case of rich people potentially controlling everything, and hey doesn't that situation sound familiar?<br>
<br>
These cases, and more, are described in the link I posted above, which I repeat here for convenience: <a href="https://antsstyle.medium.com/why-nfts-are-bad-the-long-version-2c16dae145e2#0b97">this article</a>. It's an excellent takedown of all this blockchain stuff in all its forms.<br>
<br>
To get back to proof of work for a sec.... I've said for some time that one of the problems with nuclear fusion, if it ever became a viable source of energy production, is that uses for energy naturally scale up to the supply. If we had cheap clean energy, we--as a culture--would use more of it, until we reached the point where it was relatively scarce again, and whatever limits and consequences there are on the creation of that energy would become the new strictures, and one of fusion's strictures is <i>water</i>. The massive energy consumption of proof-of-work blockchain technology is kind of vindicating in that regard, it demonstrates what I've theorized, but I'm really concerned that, wow, here it is happening in real life. If/when green energy takes off, wouldn't it be nice if it could be put in actual productive use instead of this large fraction of it going to power a stupid distributed financial system?<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/23306" target="_self">JHarris</a> at <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/193313/The-Billion-Dollar-Torrent#8172124" target="_self">9:37 AM</a>  on November 19 [<a href="https://www.metafilter.com/favorited/2/8172124" style="font-weight:normal;" title="7 users marked this as favorite">7 favorites</a>] </span></div><br><br>

As far as I can tell the basis of this blockchain has been a way to validate monetary transactions without a central authority.<br>

<br>
I don't this is the correct account of the boom mentality for tulips, late-1920s stocks, and perhaps the others. In both of those two cases at least, quite a lot of investors were quite aware that the market was a bubble and unmoored from values, and explicitly reasoned just as investors do today: "well, this market doesn't make much sense, but if I don't get in on it now I'll be missing out, and if it starts going bad I can always pull out." Many of these investors weren't complete dummies, and in fact because they considered themselves more savvy than the average investor, they figured they could get out if need be before the bulk of the market did. They just didn't realize, over and over, that when the market goes bad it's essentially instant, with instant lockup and no liquidity and no way to pull out no matter how savvy you think you are.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/80062" target="_self">chortly</a> at <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/193313/The-Billion-Dollar-Torrent#8172157" target="_self">10:10 AM</a>  on November 19 [<a href="https://www.metafilter.com/favorited/2/8172157" style="font-weight:normal;" title="9 users marked this as favorite">9 favorites</a>] </span></div><br><br>

		<a name="8172160"></a><div class="comments"><em>Fair enough, but it would be cool if you'd share that knowledge.</em><br>
<br>
Let me finish waking up and drinking my coffee and I'll drop an extinction event sized meteor of knowledge.<br>
<br>
Hey, I've been aware of BTC and cryptocoins since 2010, and I have done an embarrassing and regrettable amount of reading and homework at this point.<br>
<br>
Almost all of your talking points about cryptocoins have been refuted in previous threads, but if you want a giant horsepill sized archive of these go to old.reddit.com/r/buttcoin/ and dig into 10 years of posts and archives about this. Seriously, that sub is one of the only places to get the real news about this. You'll have to wade through memes and shitposts to get to it but it's there.<br>
<br>
Further, your talking points in this thread are nearly a complete bingo card of things that people who are new to crypto say with unwarranted enthusiasm or knowledge. Telling the thread to go read a "five-minute primer" is actually really insulting. Some of us have been aware of this stuff for over ten years.<br>
<br>
For the record I first heard about BTC when it was still possible to mine it with a CPU laptop. I once ran an experimental full node with nothing more than an unused laptop and a wifi connection borrowed from a neighborhood coffee shop that I could connect to from my apartment.<br>
<br>
Stuff like "Major adoption is happening by financial institutions!" "A whole country is using it now!" "Read the whitepapers, it'll explain everything!" and basically everything you've said so far fits this mold of either someone just starting to discover the surfaces of this space and culture or a recent buyer and holder of coins.<br>
<br>
Yes, the inflated prices of BTC the entire market cap of the entire cryptocurrency system is currently supported by both the inflated Tether peg and rampant speculation. That "2 trillion market cap" is not real.<br>
<br>
Yes, El Salvador "adopted" BTC and it's been a total shit show so far and it's an example of a large scale scam with several crypto companies in cahoots with the government. There were protests against it. You know what the citizens tried to do with the air dropped "free" 25-30 dollars worth of BTC they were given to kick start the system? They mostly tried to immediately withdraw it and convert it to the local currency. Which they found was very difficult to do. They also found that it was very difficult to actually spend it at stores to buy useful goods. The companies in charge of the local networks and systems are making a tidy profit in service fees that are totally scammy and unnecessary.<br>
<br>
Yes, every proof of work coin I've seen so far is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-sum_game">zero-sum game</a> Ponzi scheme with lots of extra steps and wasted power. It would use less power if someone just started an entirely new Amway and started manufacturing cleaning products for independent sales contractors to sell to their downline. Amway might be a scammy garbage company but in theory at least you can get some cleaning supplies and a clean kitchen and bathroom out of it.<br>
<br>
And when critics of crypto talk about zero-sum games we mean it, and we mean it in the sense that for someone might be able to get rich at the top of the pyramids a whole lot of other people have to lose their shirts, meaning that the total end value of that financial system is zero or negative. With cryptocoins this is true simply within the financial systems at hand but it's doubly true when you start adding up the environmental costs and damage costs that people will have to pay even if they didn't participate at all.<br>
<br>
Take a really step back from the hype and promises and consider this:<br>
<br>
Most proof of work crypto systems and their blockchains - especially BTC and its forks - can't actually be fully solved using plain old digital computing following Moore's Law because of the increasing difficulties of solving blocks. Like the energy and processing difficulty scales logarithmically and trends upwards nearly vertically from there. This is by design, and it's even in Satoshi's white paper and other papers about these systems. This is how securing a blockchain and network with proof of work actually works to try to prevent 51% attacks.<br>
<br>
What does this mean? This means that to secure, maintain and use a blockchain like BTC for wide scale adoption and a total financial system replacement for long term use if left unchecked it will eventually consume most if not all of the available computing power we can possibly build.<br>
<br>
We're talking like consuming entire solar systems worth of power and building planet sized computers, here. We're talking like relativistic increases in entropy and acceleration of the heat death of the universe scales to fully mine out and unlock all of 21 million BTC coins because of this ever-increasing proof of work point that secures the network.<br>
<br>
As it is now the global adoption of all of these crypto systems combined is still tiny and some fraction of a single percentage point of the total global financial market cap in total transactions, or total transactions per day, or per second - and just the BTC blockchain and network itself is already consuming more electricity than some major and well developed European Union countries all so crypto enthusiasts can solve magic internet money encryption puzzles for the block rewards.<br>
<br>
Here's another thing to consider, and on the surface it's somewhat paradoxical in light of the above:<br>
<br>
Have you stopped to consider the implications of quantum computing on a financial system that solely relies on processing cryptographic keys?<br>
<br>
Because if - well, when - quantum computing becomes useful enough to brute force cryptographic systems these blockchain systems are suddenly and instantly insecure and the whole house of cards comes tumbling down and that store of value is meaningless if someone can just brute force any and all keys.<br>
<br>
With the quantum computing threat to traditional cryptography at best we're sparking off a major arms race of increasingly costly and power intensive ways to apply and secure traditional digital cryptography or advancing new uses of quantum cryptography.<br>
<br>
<br>
Last - the Tether problem and the zero sum game of these cryptocoin systems - for everyone you know or heard about who has managed to get rich or make some money - some larger amount of people lost a larger amount of value to support some other gains within that system. By and large it's been the earliest adopters or the biggest whales who have been making any money trading in this unregulated space.<br>
<br>
If this space becomes regulated and things like high frequency automated trading or wash trading or full financial accountability become functional - you will be able to watch these market movers exiting with a quickness, extracting every value they can from their holdings and leaving all of the little people holding their bags with no exit.<br>
<br>
Smart people have been watching for the Tether system to get rug pulled or collapse under it's own weight for a few years now. For the past few years the Tether peg of 1 USDT = 1 USD has been propped up by an insane run of unbacked tether printing, sometimes a few billion USDT at a time. It is behaving and functioning exactly like an arbitrary fiat and reserve system. This is what is floating and supporting that 2 trillion dollar (or whatever) market cap.<br>
<br>
And it's fucking terrifying. There's going to be global financial fallout if this system collapses the same way we would see if a major mutual or hedge fund collapses and defaults. If it collapsed right now it would be pretty bad but not totally catastrophic, but it'll leave some millions of numbers of people holding the bags with no exit plan and with no value.<br>
<br>
But let's pretend cryptocoins succeed and wide spread global adoption happens and people can actually buy things with it almost everywhere they go:<br>
<br>
The end result is a dystopian libertarian, capitalist and neo-liberal nightmare landscape where some major percentage of our planets electricity and computing power is dedicated to supporting these decentralized financial databases with transaction rates that are so slow that they look like typos and are bad jokes. A total farce compared to how many transactions a plain old database and credit card processing system can handle with a fraction of a percent of the computing and electrical power needed for any single one of these proof of work blockchains, and there's now hundreds/thousands of these systems.<br>
<br>
We're also talking about a currency or store of value that would be inherently dynamically unstable and highly volatile because it would pegged to things like energy costs, high frequency trading and speculation, blatant market manipulation and defending and securing the network against attacks and so on.<br>
<br>
<br>
Yes, we can have a nuanced and detailed conversation about cryptocoins on MeFi. We've already had it in various threads. Some of our members are very well informed and the more informed you get the more likely you're going to see that they are scams - unless you're a scammer looking to work those scams.<br>
<br>
Yes, people should be somewhat aware of these things so they can avoid them and identify them as the very harmful pyramid and Ponzi scams that they are so they can inform their friends and family that they shouldn't be buying into them and engaging in them even if they are able to get an increased return on their investments <em>specifically because</em> they are financially and environmentally unethical.<br>
<br>
Yes, I even know some people who generated personal wealth from early adoption. Those positive numbers they got on their returns doesn't make it right or ethical.<br>
<br>
I also know a bunch of people who have lost real and significant amounts of cash, most recently in the dogecoin hype. Money is really easy to put into these systems, it's a lot more difficult to get it out.<br>
<br>
<br>
And these NFTs? They're the just the newest, most scammy layer on top of a giant birthday cake of layered scammy shit. The real world values of these things aren't in the stupid algorithmically generated collectible art but in the flexibility of wash trading. These things aren't new to the art world, the 1%ers of our financial world have been using "art" as an "investment" for money laundering and wash trading for decades already.<br>
<br>
And a lot of the value and economic movement of NFTs is just in the service fees and exchanges of people trying to jump on the NFT minting hype. It costs a pretty significant amount of real money to create, launch and register an NFT in fees or "gas" in the case of the Ethereum network in particular.<br>
<br>
<br>
If you (the proverbial, general you) or anyone is buying into the very real world Tulip Mania hype of cryptocoins you're actively participating in these scams.<br>

<br>
And they may well actually have something of value to offer if/when that happens.<br>
<br>
For example, one of the strongest criticisms levelled at blockchain-based remittance systems such as Stellar is that transactions are irreversible once made. That's a thing that cannot be fixed, because it's inherent in the nature of an append-only public ledger where transactions can only ever be initiated by the holders of the secret keys that authenticate the accounts.<br>
<br>
The tradeoff is that Stellar transactions are insanely cheap - so much less than a cent apiece that they might as well cost nothing unless you're trying to spam the network with a high frequency bot.<br>
<br>
A Visa or Mastercard or PayPal could act as an intermediary between parties to Stellar-based remittances, much as they already do for those based on national currencies, and offer the same kind of chargeback and other buyer protections that they already do today. As a for-profit oligopoly they'd clearly charge <em>way</em> more for this kind of service than what they lose to fraud, just like they do already; but because the transaction costs in the underlying remittance system are so <em>crazy</em> low compared to SWIFT transactions they'd likely be able to do that while <em>still</em> charging less for a buyer protection layer added to Stellar than for what they currently offer.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/20036" target="_self">flabdablet</a> at <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/193313/The-Billion-Dollar-Torrent#8172178" target="_self">10:50 AM</a>  on November 19 </span></div><br><br>

I think that we can safely toss this apples-to-oranges comparison right into the compost heap even before we try to tally up the energy/cost savings earned by preventing spambots and related financial/energy frictions.<br>
<br>
Granted they're also using ReCaptchas to offload and crowdsource the training of artificial intelligence machine vision systems for what will likely end up being malicious purposes but whatever, on balance it's tiny compared to magic internet money number puzzles.<br>
<br>
<em>I would be super interested in learning more about what's going to happen when the cryptocurrency bubble collapses.</em><br>
<br>
Mainly there's going to be a lot of little people who lose out economically and left holding the bags and it will resemble stock market and penny stock collapses or what happens when other Ponzi schemes collapse and run out of fresh blood to feast on.<br>
<br>
<br>
Another point I wanted to touch on is that yes, our current economic system sucks and one of the many things that cryptocurrency promises is that it might liberate people from these systems, even to the point of causing entire nation states to collapse.<br>
<br>
It won't. If anything it's going to accelerate financial dependence and the many negative issues of the current status quo of capitalism and make it even worse.<br>
<br>
When you peel back the many layers of this and start digging in way past the mainly libertarian talking points on this angle what we're left with is essentially the Austrian School of Economics written out as code, with code as law, and it's fucking nightmare fuel for more of the same neo-liberal and libertarian horseshit on crack and it's not going to "save" or "liberate" anyone from these systems.<br>
<br>
Even though these decentralized systems try to talk a lot of big talk about being trustless, they also all rely on trust. Exchanges live and die by the implications of trust. Meeting people locally for the direct purchase or exchange of cryptocurrencies relies on the concept of trust. Even vendors on the black markets on the darknet like Silk Road have had to rely on trust and reputation scores of their vendors and the markets themselves being trustworthy enough to use.<br>
<br>
At the end of it all the only real currency is trust and all functioning economic systems stem from this trust.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/17349" target="_self">loquacious</a> at <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/193313/The-Billion-Dollar-Torrent#8172220" target="_self">11:41 AM</a>  on November 19 [<a href="https://www.metafilter.com/favorited/2/8172220" style="font-weight:normal;" title="10 users marked this as favorite">10 favorites</a>] </span></div><br><br>

<br>
Oh, don't misinterpret me as saying that quantum computing is a sure thing, but it's definitely something that the cryptocurrency space is willfully ignoring on purpose.<br>
<br>
But at this point it sure looks like quantum computing as some kind of useful thing is going to happen at some level, and if so it will mean some dire things about cryptography and privacy in general even if it can only be affordable to be useful to state level powers, and this mirrors and maps nicely to the existing history of computing and how the first real Turing complete computers were insanely expensive projects undertaken by major nation states to crack wartime cryptography or other military uses of computing.<br>
<br>
And if quantum computing is usefully applied to code breaking it's probably going to spark off an arms race of also applying quantum computing to quantum cryptography solutions and security just like non-quantum computing did.<br>
<br>
Sure, this also implies the paradox that quantum computing and cryptography can also be applied to securing blockchain networks if there's enough of a financial reward or interest to fund that arms race just as much as it could be used to attack and crack those networks...<br>
<br>
...but if I wanted to dive down this hairy rabbit hole of theoretical number theory and completeness again I would much rather take a heroically mind-bending dose of mushrooms and re-read <em>Godel, Escher and Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid</em> in one go.<br>

		<a name="8172237"></a><div class="comments">There was some discussion about blockchain versus public key cryptography above. I'll give my non-expert summary of that, in the hopes it might help.<br>
<br>
In Public Key cryptography you have a secret key - a long random string which is known only to you. This secret key has a matching public key, which is derived from your actual key. That's a one way transformation - the public key can't be used to derive your secret key, and can be shared with world.<br>
<br>
If I have a piece of information that I'd like to publish, I can use my secret key to produce a signature of that information. Anyone with the public key can then verify that this piece of information was signed by the holder of the corresponding secret key. It's then a matter of trusting that I am the only person with that secret key, and you've now verified that I published that information and it hasn't been altered.<br>
<br>
This is very useful and can form the basis of any kind of system in which you trust a central authority. If I trust Visa to say what financial transaction occurred, then Visa can maintain a ledger of those transactions, and I can obtain a copy of that ledger and verify that it came from Visa. I can transmit my personal transactions back to Visa and Visa can verify that those came from me and add them to the central ledger they maintain if they think I have the right to make those transactions.<br>
<br>
Blockchain introduces a secure, distributed ledger. The major innovation is that new transactions are added to the ledger not by coordination with a central authority, but by the consensus of the network. Anyone can get a copy of the ledger and verify it piecewise, with the limitation that the only thing you can transact on this ledger are the digital tokens that comprise the network itself.<br>
<br>
This is a very cool piece of technology, but one without an obvious use. We can attach a meaning outside of the system to the tokens, but doing so negates the trust-less aspects of the blockchain. If the meaning of a token is outside of itself, then we have to develop a system for trusting how that meaning was assigned.<br>
<br>
Let's take car titles, which were mentioned above. I can create a token on a trustless blockchain which represents the title to my car. But since the blockchain is trustless, anyone else can make another token which also claims to represent title to my car. Okay, so maybe we have a central authority who we trust to create the car title tokens, and after that the blockchain takes the wheel. Anyone can still make a token that has the same claim, but we can verify that that token didn't originate with our trusted party. That could involve public key signing. What now? Well, we've re-introduced a central authority, but they don't have to maintain the ledger themselves. That might be a good thing, but it's not at all clear that it is when balanced against the other concerns going on. <br>
<br>
You do get some other potential benefits: immutability and uniqueness among them. Those sounds good, but lead to their own problems. If my car title is a blockchain token, and that token is by fraud or accident transferred to someone else, what then? I still have the car. The central authority has washed their hands of it, and the transaction is immutable, so I can't get the token back. If the token has the force of law as my title, then I don't actually own the car anymore, and probably need to pay whatever ransom is demanded. Or maybe I can convince the central authority to issue a new token for me, and somehow declare the old one invalid. That's ideal, but now we've lost the whole point of the central authority not maintaining the ledger themselves.<br>
<br>
That kind of brings things around to smart contracts. Smart contracts allow additional rules and stipulations to be built around future transactions involving a particular token. That sounds neat, but the same problems show up - there's very little recourse if anything goes wrong (hard fork of Eth nonwithstanding). And the truth is - we've had smart contracts for thousands of years - they're called contracts. <br>
<br>
"Smart Contracts" are only appealing if you trust computer code over the legal system. The kinds of people developing blockchain technology are probably going to think that's a good idea, because they understand code well, and legal stuff not very well. But law and code are equally foreign to most people, and there's good reasons why the legal system is the way it is.<br>
<br>
Ultimately there are very few to no problems that the blockchain solves. We are witnesses to a financial scam of the largest proportions, and the sooner it collapses the less people will be hurt. The sooner it collapses, the less damage will have been done to the environment. It is a moral imperative to call it out as the scam it is, and do what we can to put an end to it.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/167509" target="_self">vibratory manner of working</a> at <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/193313/The-Billion-Dollar-Torrent#8172237" target="_self">12:22 PM</a>  on November 19 [<a href="https://www.metafilter.com/favorited/2/8172237" style="font-weight:normal;" title="21 users marked this as favorite">21 favorites</a>] </span></div><br><br>

This has always been my impression of blockchain tech too.

<br>
We have that. It's the decentralized system known as "trade", and what it trusts in is a general expectation that all traders are going to judge the value of what's being traded in <em>roughly</em> the same way.<br>
<br>
The tradeable value of a token, then, is the outcome of a distributed process of guessing and second-guessing and second-second-guessing and so on. This is a process that's <em>chock-a-block</em> with all kinds of feedback loops, both positive and negative, and the result is that the assigned value is inherently chaotic.<br>
<br>
People who think that Bitcoin is going to play Number Go Up forever are probably wrong. People who think Bitcoin is going to crash to near zero at some point soon are probably wrong as well. The simple fact is that <em>nobody</em> can predict, with any reasonable degree of certainty, what the market price of a Bitcoin or any other digital token will be at this time next year or any other year.<br>
<br>
And just as with trading in <em>any</em> volatile commodity, the overall operation of the market results in money being continuously ratcheted from weak hands into strong hands. If you're already wealthy and well diversified enough <em>not to have to care</em> when your Bitcoin holding loses 60% of its nominal value in a day, you <em>won't</em> panic and sell it off when you see it doing that; you'll probably buy the dip instead, paying people who <em>are</em> panicking a <em>fraction</em> of what they bought their own tiny holdings for - quite possibly from you - the previous week, and at some point there will be enough big money buying the dip to put a floor under it.<br>
<br>
Bitcoin isn't a pyramid scheme, in that it <em>isn't</em> funnelling most of the money paid for it toward the early adopters. It used to be that, but not any more. What it is now is an increasingly well established commodity, highly volatile by design, that funnels most of the money paid for it toward the same small group of well diversified and very wealthy speculators that <em>everything else</em> funnels money toward as well.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/20036" target="_self">flabdablet</a> at <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/193313/The-Billion-Dollar-Torrent#8172254" target="_self">1:03 PM</a>  on November 19 [<a href="https://www.metafilter.com/favorited/2/8172254" style="font-weight:normal;" title="2 users marked this as favorite">2 favorites</a>] </span></div><br><br>

Any law that would contemplate the use of NFTs as <em>legal</em> proof of ownership for physical assets would presumably be framed in such a way as to impose a cooling off period following the movement of any such NFT to a different account, during which refusal by any new holder of that NFT to reverse, on request, the transaction by which they acquired it would amount to breaking the law.<br>

In addition to *waves hands energetically* all of this I find that it's curious that we can barely even seem to ask ourselves the question the morality or ethics of speculation-driven trading and trading practices in general - about almost any trading markets, instruments or practices or the ethics of extracting financial value without creating any in return through these instruments, strategies and methods.<br>
<br>
Trading commodities, currency and metals in particular seem particularly harmful and exploitative.<br>
<br>
Why is it that the status quo is such that we're not even asking if this entire system of financial arbitrage and wealth extraction through trading is a net good for humanity?<br>
<br>
How many truly terrible, exploitative things have now been done to people and our environment in the name of stock prices and returns on investment demands?<br>
<br>
<br>
And people are buying into the idea and trusting that a bunch of very technocratic and generally libertarian new Guilded Age tech bros armed with malformed ethics routines who are running the the cryptocoin space are going to make these issues somehow <em>better</em> and less harmful or exploitative!?<br>

I would imagine most of the people who post on this site don't spend a lot of time asking that because we already know the answer: it isn't.<br>

I wonder if any decrease of trust in a system necessarily leads to higher cost.  If you don't trust your shoppers to wander the aisles themselves, you have to hire enough people to serve every product to every customer.  If you don't trust the neighbouring city, you have to spend a bunch on walls.

Agreed. From which it follows that at some point we may well see the rise of token haven jurisdictions that operate in much the same way as today's tax havens do, where those who have no qualms about ripping off the rest of us can simply bribe and browbeat corrupt officials into providing them with ways to hide their assets - even if the rest of the world has put international agreements in place that make it illegal to transact on any blockchain used for establishing legal ownership claims without strong and provable one-to-one linkages between personal identity and account identity.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/20036" target="_self">flabdablet</a> at <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/193313/The-Billion-Dollar-Torrent#8172277" target="_self">1:56 PM</a>  on November 19 [<a href="https://www.metafilter.com/favorited/2/8172277" style="font-weight:normal;" title="1 user marked this as favorite">1 favorite</a>] </span></div><br><br>

There's a lot of disadvantages to current banking, for example how credit card companies pocket several percent of every transaction. I was very interested when I heard about bitcoin in 2011 and read quite a bit about it. Blockchain is an interesting idea, but it really doesn't add much to existing cryptographic or distributed database technology. However proof-of-work is the most ruinous idea that has ever come out of software engineering. Although the technology had its fascinating parts, especially related to the development of hardware mining, I decided crypto wasn't for me, and I'm glad I did.<br>
<br>
Ethereum (where most of these NFTs are stored) is using an estimated <a href="https://digiconomist.net/ethereum-energy-consumption">88 TWh of electricity per year</a>, and has risen by 8 times over in the past year. It may be small compared to some sorts of energy consumption (e.g. worldwide aluminum production is about 1000 TWh), but it's a massive amount for something so niche. That's 180 kWh per transaction: 200,000 times more energy than a credit card transaction or 6 days of an average household's electricity usage. Bitcoin uses twice the electricity overall, and over 10x per transaction. A massive amount of resources go into making the machines themselves as well. All this computation has no end product other than the crypto itself.<br>
<br>
Value is a strange concept, because it boils down to an agreement. It could be a custom or tradition, or it could be the newest hottest thing. Tesla has a market cap greater than Toyota, Volkswagen, Daimler, GM, BMW, Ford, Honda, Ferrari, Hyundai and Kia combined. That seems a bit overpriced to me, since Tesla made 500,000 cars last year where the rest made 44 million. Still, I'm sure there are many that would want to buy so they don't miss out. If we average everybody out, we get market value, which is probably about as good as you'll get for a generally-agreed value.<br>
<br>
Gold has had a fairly hefty market value for a long time, seemingly well above its practical or decorative uses. We dig up mountains and soak them in arsenic to expand the amount we've got by 1% a year. It's the kind of thing we would put a stop to if we were rational, since we've got so much of it laying around. But crypto makes it look green: they dig up $200B a year worth of it using less energy than bitcoin does to "mine" $20B.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/253452" target="_self">netowl</a> at <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/193313/The-Billion-Dollar-Torrent#8172280" target="_self">1:58 PM</a>  on November 19 [<a href="https://www.metafilter.com/favorited/2/8172280" style="font-weight:normal;" title="7 users marked this as favorite">7 favorites</a>] </span></div><br><br>

Ok, but what's the life cycle of that NFT? What does it even look like? Cars at least have a VIN, which I guess would be the token but what about assets which don't have a convenient identifier? Who mints the NFT? If the asset was financed, does the bank "own" the token? Who's responsible for maintaining the external database which lists the liens and the holder of those loans? If the asset is destroyed, does ownership just end? How is the NFT destroyed?<br>

But as I mentioned above, there is no reason why a third party payment processor could not use Stellar to send and receive payments on your behalf while offering the same range of buyer protections that today's existing third party payment processors (including banks) already do.<br>
<br>
There would certainly be a cost associated with these over and above that imposed by the underlying remittance network, to pay for such fraud as the payment processor ended up eating, exactly as already happens today; but since Stellar costs so much less per transaction than e.g. SWIFT, and is less inherently vulnerable to identity theft than credit cards are, I would expect that even such feeble competition as exists within today's payment processing oligopoly would yield lower prices for Stellar-based transactions than for those that resolve to conventional bank transfers.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/20036" target="_self">flabdablet</a> at <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/193313/The-Billion-Dollar-Torrent#8172292" target="_self">2:34 PM</a>  on November 19 [<a href="https://www.metafilter.com/favorited/2/8172292" style="font-weight:normal;" title="1 user marked this as favorite">1 favorite</a>] </span></div><br><br>

This needs to be kept secure inside your Stellar wallet software, which all the available wallet software is designed to make easy to do.<br>
<br>
Completely unlike a credit card number, your secret key is <em>never</em> revealed in the transactions recorded on the Stellar blockchain. Instead, your wallet software uses it internally to <em>sign</em> the payments it submits to the blockchain, which allows anybody to use your <em>public</em> key to verify those signatures.<br>
<br>
Your public key is also the only one used to identify you when other people pay Stellar tokens into your wallet.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/20036" target="_self">flabdablet</a> at <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/193313/The-Billion-Dollar-Torrent#8172294" target="_self">2:40 PM</a>  on November 19 </span></div><br><br>

<br>
This task is a natural fit for personal password management software, which everybody ought to be using as a matter of course anyway. I use and recommend <a href="https://keepassxc.org/">KeePassXC</a> for this job.<br>
<br>
Of course, if you <em>are</em> relying on that kind of software to back up the recovery passphrases for your Stellar secret keys then you need to keep the master password for your password manager at least as secure, and its passwords database files at least as well backed up, as you'd have to keep your Stellar recovery passphrase.

The basis of the suit was the SEC's allegation that Ripple's digital currency XRP amounted to an unregistered security rather than the commodity almost everybody else thinks it is. <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/ripple-vs-sec/#h-october-15-2021">The case is ongoing.</a><br>
<br>
2: Stellar has indeed <a href="https://github.com/stellar/stellar-core/blob/master/docs/software/security-protocol-release-notes.md">fixed bugs</a> in both the design and implementation of its consensus protocol since version 1. The protocol is currently at version 18 and there's a robust mechanism in place for voting on and testing out proposed updates. I don't think "completely changed" is a fair characterization of this process.<br>
<br>
3: Anybody can create as many Stellar accounts as they want, but each account has to maintain a minimum 1 XLM balance, currently worth about 36c US, in order to be able to send funds anywhere else. This is purely to stop spam-scale bulk account creation. It's not a proof-of-stake in any way fundamental to the operation of the consensus protocol and has nothing to do with limiting the transaction rate. If the market price of XLM rises significantly I'm quite sure that the protocol will be revised to lower the minimum balance accordingly.<br>
<br>
4: The Stellar inflation mechanism (inactivated two years ago) was designed to let Stellar users vote for other users, who would then be issued the tokens generated by the inflation mechanism in proportion to votes received once a minimum threshold was reached. Xlmpool was one of several organizations created for the sole purpose of subverting this essentially charitable mechanism: the idea was that if you voted for xlmpool as your preferred inflation target then xlmpool would return 90% of the inflation lumens it collected to you. It was made quite clear that the xlmpool founders would indeed keep the remaining 10% for themselves, and I don't understand why anybody would have been confused by this. Nobody was ever forced to vote for xlmpool, and those who did got <em>something</em> out of doing so for no initial outlay of their own.<br>
<br>
Neither the inflation mechanism itself, nor the voting process, nor such repayments as xlmpool made to those who voted for it, would have required disclosure of secret keys. The <em>only</em> valid reasons for a Stellar secret key to leave the wallet that created it are to make the same account operable using other wallet software (perhaps on another device), or to make a disaster recovery backup. There <em>were</em> some proposed inflation pools available that did ask for secret keys - I have no idea what their excuse was - but as far as I know, xlmpool wasn't one of them.<br>
<br>
There has also always been a certain amount of payment spam on Stellar, where scammers include a URL in the payment memo field and take the usual kinds of advantage of naive users who click on those, including soliciting secret keys from them. Most Stellar-compatible wallets have been entirely suppressing in-UI notifications of small incoming payments for some time now for exactly that reason. You can still get a complete record of the transactions in and out of any Stellar account, including your own (or xlmpool's, come to that), by pasting its <em>public</em> Stellar key into any of the many online Stellar blockchain explorers.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/20036" target="_self">flabdablet</a> at <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/193313/The-Billion-Dollar-Torrent#8172318" target="_self">4:42 PM</a>  on November 19 </span></div><br><br>

I'm not really talking about direct market trading and delivery of real world physical goods and commodities.<br>
<br>
What I'm really talking about is arbitrage involving futures, leveraged speculation and practices like short selling as found in commodities trading where there is never any intent to receive or deliver goods, where the only goal is to exploit and extract profits while delivering no useful product other than increasing market price volatility and instability while leaving either producers or consumers paying the costs of decreased or increased spot prices.<br>
<br>
<em>Do you have an alternative plan?</em><br>
<br>
Not really, no. And if I did I wouldn't be surprised if I ended up dead for pissing off the wrong people.<br>
<br>
Banning the practice of trading commodities or trading with leveraged arbitrage might be a good place to start.<br>
<br>
Or banning or taxing anything that employs the practices of trading as a career that does nothing but extract wealth from the process of arbitrage, market spreads or volatility without ever actually delivering any goods or services.<br>
<br>
There's something morally and ethically fundamentally wrong to this idea that someone can take a pile of money, use that to secure a large loan, use that now larger pile of money or credit to drive up the price of a commodity that's food that people actually need to eat and then call that a good or smart thing that they made a even more money even though someone else now probably has to pay more money to eat and the farmer that actually produced it usually didn't get paid more to make the commodity in this process.<br>
<br>
To me there's something very seriously wrong with this, and it's just one of the many things about our financial system that end up functionally being financial crimes against humanity.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/17349" target="_self">loquacious</a> at <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/193313/The-Billion-Dollar-Torrent#8172463" target="_self">9:22 AM</a>  on November 20 [<a href="https://www.metafilter.com/favorited/2/8172463" style="font-weight:normal;" title="4 users marked this as favorite">4 favorites</a>] </span></div><br><br>

No, it's a beautifully constructed troll designed to induce the kind of person who thinks they're cleverer than anybody who has ever bought an NFT to sabotage their own BitTorrent seedbox by making it preallocate 20TB of disk space which it then proceeds to fill almost all of with <em>nothing whatsoever.</em><br>

You wouldn't need a huge SSD array to seed this thing, by the way: most modern filesystems support sparse files, which allow you to store blocks full of zeroes at no disk cost.

That comes to 37,820,930,457,600, which is much bigger than the 14,921,943,519,817 size of ethereum.rar, so it's unlikely to become mountable without first being extended to full length even when completely downloaded.<br>

There's also this:<br>

So what he's done here is create this huge empty filesystem image, given ext4lazyinit five minutes to scribble enough filesystem structure into it to put at least one nonzero byte somewhere inside each of the first 320 32MiB pieces, then published it.

I also wonder how many people he's actually tricked into trying to allocate 18TB - it's an awfully ambitious up-front ask given that NFT cultists are all over "the files aren't the point, it's the ownership" or whatever and NFT critics tend to find them aesthetically bankrupt.<br>

		<a name="8172972"></a><div class="comments">I'm actually shocked by the self-defeating actions on both sides of NFTbay "versus" cryptobros - on one side, some NFT guy with a fascist frog avatar whose process is just photoshopping the fascist frog onto more well-known artworks (and who trades under a name derived from a famous painter) sells an NFT of the NFTbay URL and/or a screenshot of it, thus further compromising their side's claim that NFTs have any value as a way of transferring ownership.<br>
On the other, Geoff compromises his claim to be against NFT trading by promoting the above NFT and putting his own one up for sale, compromises his denunciation of cryptocurrency as a scam by saying he'll donate the proceeds to some charity, and compromises his claim that he'll donate to charity by attaching it to an NFT sale. During the scuffle, according to the cryptobros in his replies he accidentally shows a crypto wallet that he used to buy some crap dinosaur NFTs. But despite all this he really badly wants to get an interview with the New York Post about how meta his art project is. And both sides presumably clink their on-chain piss-beer NFC-chip microbrewery bottles and have a chuckle about how many GWh they just burned.<br>
