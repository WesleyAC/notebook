		this website (everything residing on the domain "wesleyac.com", excluding
		subdomains) should be thought of as a jungle — attempts to link to it are at
		your own risk.
		<br>
		<br>
		you may attempt to archive it, but should you wish to avoid sadness down the
		line, you should accept now in your heart that all archives will eventually
		succumb to the sands of time.

		<blockquote style="max-width: 50rem;">
			It is difficult for anyone born and raised in human infrastructure to truly internalize the fact that your view of the world is backward. Even if you fully know that you live in a natural world that existed before you and will continue long after, even if you know that the wilderness is the default state of things, and that nature is not something that only happens in carefully curated enclaves between towns, something that pops up in empty spaces if you ignore them for a while, even if you spend your whole life believing yourself to be deeply in touch with the ebb and flow, the cycle, the ecosystem as it actually is, you will still have trouble picturing an untouched world. You will still struggle to understand that human constructs are carved out and overlaid, that these are the places that are the in-between, not the other way around.
