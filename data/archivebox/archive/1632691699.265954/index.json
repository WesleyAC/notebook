                    "\n  Every few months it\u2019ll send me a postcard. Once, in the midst of the pandemic, the company even sent salespeople to my door.\nAT&T wants to sell me 1,000Mbps fiber-optic internet, and I\u2019m beyond ready to pay for it. In fact, I\u2019ve already signed the contract at least nine times now. \nBut like tens of millions of my fellow citizens across the United States, I don\u2019t actually have the ability to switch. Across the country, the FCC and internet service providers are pretending there\u2019s competition in an unimaginable number of places where it doesn\u2019t actually exist. It\u2019s a nationwide problem, but one that I\u2019m experiencing even in the Silicon Valley \u2014 where you\u2019d think the internet might be better.\n  \n  \n    \n    \n      \n        \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n    \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n        I ordered AT&T Fiber at least nine times. It never rejected me.\n      \n      \n        Screenshot by Sean Hollister / The Verge\n      \n    \n  \n\n\nToday, I pay $100 a month for Comcast internet, and the cable company\u2019s speeds leave something to be desired. My wife, a video producer, can\u2019t reliably upload her company\u2019s videos to its FTP servers. The family videos we shoot on our smartphones take hours to appear in Google Photos, and there\u2019s no point in me even trying to stream games to YouTube or Twitch. While my download speed is decent at 200Mbps, the uploads are absolutely atrocious at just 5Mbps up, and I\u2019d have to pay Comcast even more to change that. And my bill has already gone up: I paid $70 until the pandemic hit and we started running into Comcast\u2019s completely arbitrary 1.2TB data cap. Now, I have to pay extra for unlimited so I don\u2019t rack up overage fees every single month. (Disclosure: Comcast and NBCUniversal are investors in Vox Media, parent company of The Verge)\nAT&T seems like the obvious answer. The company\u2019s fiber network offers 1,000Mbps downloads and 1,000Mbps uploads for $70 a month, no data cap whatsoever. Competition is good, eh? The only problem is that AT&T doesn\u2019t actually serve my address... even though it continues to insist it does. The company\u2019s field technicians have visited my home easily a dozen times now, but their conclusion is always the same: AT&T buried its fiber in the wrong place.\nA few houses down from me, there\u2019s a concrete cover embedded in the pavement. If you look underneath, you\u2019ll find a fiber-optic node labeled with my exact street address. It\u2019s supposed to be in front of my home; AT&T\u2019s service maps say it\u2019s in front of my home, but those maps are wrong.\n  \n  \n    \n    \n      \n        \n\n\n\n      \n    \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n        Where AT&T\u2019s fiber should be vs. where it actually is. One day, I walked outside to find these chalk arrows connecting the two \u2014 false hope, sadly.\n      \n      \n        GIF by Sean Hollister/The Verge\n      \n    \n  \n\n\n\nThe more grizzled AT&T vets warned me I\u2019d get no satisfaction from AT&T. They told me it was illegal to run wires over my particular street \u2014 and that there was little to no chance AT&T would spend $10,000+ to dig up the sidewalk just to serve more houses on my side of the road.\nSome friendly techs filed dig tickets anyhow! I was told at least twice it was actually going to happen. (AT&T sales reps told me it had already happened according to their records.) Once, I even got an actual notice from AT&T that my order had been canceled. But every other time, I\u2019d call weeks later to find out my order had simply, quietly vanished.\nIf the company wasn\u2019t going to give me internet, why couldn\u2019t it remove me from its marketing lists? Why couldn\u2019t it simply update its maps? \nThat last question, it turns out, is far bigger than I imagined. It may help explain why America\u2019s internet is so broken to begin with, and get us on the path to fixing it.\nAs FCC Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel wrote for The Verge last March, as many as one in three US households doesn\u2019t have broadband internet access, currently defined as just 25Mbps down and 3Mbps up \u2014 which feels like the bare minimum for a remote learning family these days. Even before the pandemic, that statistic might have been shocking; now, it\u2019s the difference between whether millions of schoolchildren can attend classes and do their homework or not. Nearly 12 million children don\u2019t have a broadband connection at home, the Senate Joint Economic Committee reported in 2017. And the \u201chomework gap\u201d hits harder if you\u2019re poor, of course: only 56 percent of households with incomes under $30,000 had broadband as of last February, according to the Pew Research Center. \nBut even if they could afford broadband, there\u2019s no guarantee they\u2019d get it \u2014 because the FCC has spent the past decade trying to paint a rosy picture of America\u2019s broadband instead of figuring out where it actually exists.\nIn 2009, the US spent $350 million on a \u201cNational Broadband Map\u201d that turned out to be nothing more than a chance for the wolves to guard the hens: it relied on ISPs like Comcast and AT&T to submit their own data, which the FCC does not audit. According to the FCC\u2019s map, I have 11 different broadband providers at my address! But if you break it down:\n\nTwo of them are \u201cfixed wireless\u201d that cater to businesses, not homes, one of which starts at $99 a month for 3Mbps (not a typo)\nTwo of them are slow, data-capped satellite internet\nFour of them are duplicates of the same providers (including three different tiers of AT&T DSL, two of which don't meet the FCC's definition of broadband)\nTwo of them don\u2019t offer service at my address at all\n\nThat leaves me with just Comcast \u2014 and you with the reason why the United States and its ISP lobbyists get to pretend they\u2019re doing a decent job, even when there\u2019s no meaningful competition. About 88.3 million Americans only have a single choice of broadband provider, according to the Institute for Local Self-Reliance, because their other choice is DSL that doesn\u2019t even meet the FCC\u2019s own definition of broadband at 25Mbps down / 3Mbps up. That\u2019s effectively a monopoly, and the report claims 22 million of them are dependent on Comcast alone. And those are *low* estimates, by the way, because they\u2019re based on the same faulty, self-reported data as the FCC\u2019s terrible maps. \nWhen Comcast knows you have no other alternative, it can get away with things you\u2019d never see anywhere else. Exhibit A: the 1.2TB home internet data caps it\u2019s about to erect in a dozen additional states next year. \n  \n  \n    \n    \n      \n        \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n    \n    \n  \n  \n\n\n\nForget for a moment that Comcast itself was caught red-handed explaining that data caps have nothing to do with network congestion. Forget that the CEOs of several smaller ISPs have admitted that internet capacity is anything but scarce. Forget that Comcast disabled its own congestion management system because it found it was unnecessary. Forget even that Comcast is a wildly profitable company whose cable division spends only a tenth of its yearly revenues on keeping that network strong. The proof that data caps are a swindle is something you probably witnessed yourself earlier this year: Comcast, AT&T, and T-Mobile all suspended their data caps when the pandemic hit, and the internet kept on working without a hitch. \nBut Comcast\u2019s generosity didn\u2019t last for long. Now, with cases and deaths repeatedly hitting record highs in the United States, tens of millions of Americans out of work, and many of them thousands of dollars behind on rent, the ISP is so unconcerned about angry customers that it\u2019s bringing those data caps to even more states. AT&T, to its credit, extended its initial data cap waiver through the end of the year \u2014 but that wasn\u2019t enough to pressure Comcast to do the same. Comcast\u2019s waiver expired on July 1st, alongside most other ISPs, and now it\u2019s back to extracting money hand over fist. \nExhibit B: Though the United States once led development of the world\u2019s internet, we now pay more than the rest of the developed world on average. \n\nWe consistently pay more than Europe regardless of speed, according to a fascinating, approachable study you should read from the New America think tank. In fact, we pay roughly double that of Europe at the 100Mbps and 1,000Mbps tiers, and eight to 17 times more to rent a modem on average than Asia and Europe do, respectively. Only one US city cracked the top ten in affordability but only because it had an ace up its sleeve: a municipal fiber-optic network erected by the city itself, where ISPs provide their services across fiber that the residents themselves own. Those sorts of municipal networks create competition that simply doesn\u2019t exist in many places in the US because it wasn\u2019t designed to exist. In places that do erect municipal networks, New America shows that both speed and affordability far outpace the rest of the US. \nThat\u2019s why it\u2019s a real shame many states (and telecom lobbyists) have erected roadblocks to keep those municipal networks from spreading. In one particularly egregious example, Comcast sued the city of Chattanooga, Tennessee to try to block its municipal network in 2015, lobbied for a law to prevent its award-winning network from expanding to rural areas, then finally convinced the state to spend $45 million of taxpayer money to subsidize the big ISPs instead. \n\nWe need competition. We need accurate maps to clearly see just how little competition there actually is, and we need to change the laws to let citizens fed up with being unserved and underserved build their own networks instead. We need those maps to show how much people actually pay. We need to stop pouring taxpayer money into hugely profitable telecoms that claim they\u2019ll build out internet access, since they\u2019ve found they can often just straight-up lie or wait to be sued instead of fulfilling their obligations. (If you want to be infuriated, follow that last link and keep on clicking through the examples.)\nAt least in 2020, the US is finally making some progress. This year, Congress finally passed a bill that requires the FCC to actually audit its broadband map data and create a \u201cuser-friendly challenge process\u201d so people like me can point out that no, AT&T doesn\u2019t actually offer fiber (or even fast DSL) at my address. Here's hoping it actually works, unlike the millions upon millions of net neutrality comments the FCC simply ignored. Earlier this month, the FCC also already awarded $9.2 billion to 180 different companies to bring broadband to 5.2 million rural Americans over the next ten years \u2014 though big companies like Charter, CenturyLink, Frontier, and Windstream still account for at least $2.4 billion of it. \nBut another way of looking at things is that we\u2019re already too late: the FCC just awarded a decade\u2019s worth of money to bring broadband to only five million additional addresses, without knowing whether it was awarding those contracts to communities that will now see competition \u2014 or just erecting more pockets of monopoly on the fringe. What is the rest of America supposed to do, wait another decade? \nWe need to go much, much further than fixing our maps. If the best we can do during the pandemic is ask ISPs to \u201cpretty please make the internet work better for 60 days,\u201d to borrow a phrase, it\u2019s time for more regulation.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has shown, perhaps for the first time, how essential the internet is. The internet was already a powerful tool for learning, but now it\u2019s a critical one for kids to attend school. Many millions are jobless but could maybe find a new job that lets them work from home. Many are already working from home because \u2014 with no other choice \u2014 companies are learning to adapt. \nThis all means there might finally be enough political will to declare the internet should be delivered to homes like a utility, the way water and electricity are delivered today, the way landline telephones were under the Communications Act of 1934 that originally created the FCC. The last time the law was truly overhauled was 1996 \u2014 back when the internet was delivered one digital screech at a time over standard phone lines, after all. \nThat\u2019s how we\u2019ve always dealt with necessary monopolies, the ones that own the pipes and wires that feed your house. We put them on a tight leash and make them serve everyone, not just the homes they deem most profitable. \n\n\n  \n"
