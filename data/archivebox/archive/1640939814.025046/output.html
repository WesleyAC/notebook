<p><b>The strange case of virtual machines on telephones</b></p>
<ul><i>"Look, theory says that a JIT can run as fast as, or maybe faster than, a
statically compiled language.  It might be slow right now, but it'll be much
better when we get a real/better JIT.  Plus, the new version is already a
lot faster, and I'm looking forward to the next version, which they promise
will have huge speed improvements."</i><p>-- Every Java user since
1996</p></ul>

<p>If you've been saying the above about your Android phone (or Blackberry),
then you, too, have become part of the decade-and-a-half-long train wreck of
computer science that is Java.</p>
<p>I'm often mystified at the rejection of reality displayed by the proponents
of Java-like virtual machines.  It seems a simple statement of fact:
even after 14 years, Java is still <i>much</i> slower than native code, and
you can <i>see it clearly</i> just by looking at any app for 10 seconds.  And
yet the excuses above keep coming.  14 years.</p>
<p>But then I think, I know how this delusion works.  I've been guilty of
it myself.  At my first company, I pushed to
have all our data interchange sent through an API that I
designed - UniConf - which was unfortunately slower in almost all
cases than <i>not</i> using it.
The idea was that if only all our code could be <b>100% pure UniConf</b>
then we'd suddenly be able to realize tons of wonderful advantages.</p>
<p>But despite herculean efforts, the advantages never materialized.  What
materialized was a lot of slowness, a lot of excessive memory usage, and a
lot of weird bugs that forced us to backtrack through seven layers of
overly-generalized code to diagnose.</p>
<p>Luckily for me, lack of resources prevented my own madness from spreading
too far.  I'm much better now.<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>But what would it be like if the madness had been successful?  What if I had
been responsible for a system that spread to millions of users worldwide,
which in nearly every case made things <i>visibly and obviously worse?</i>
What would that do to my psyche?  I think it would be unbearable.</p>
<p>Which brings us to Java-like VMs on cell phones.  I have a lot of sympathy
here, because:</p>
<p><b>Java used to be a good idea.  Really.</b></p>
<p>Java on cell phones has not <i>always</i> been obviously a bad idea.  To see
why, you have to understand a bit about how these systems evolved.</p>
<p>First of all, we have little visibility into the Java's original reason for
being.  We know what people <i>said</i>, but we don't know if they said that
for marketing or retroactive justification.  What we <i>do</i> know is that
the original sales push behind Java was applets for your web browser.  Rich,
client-side web applications.</p>
<p>Client-side web applications have exactly one super difficult critical
requirement: security.  You're downloading random apps from the Internet
automatically and you want to run them automatically, and some of these apps
will <i>definitely</i> be written by evil people and try to screw you, so you
need a defense mechanism.  Moreover, most people doing this will be doing it
on Windows, which at the time meant Windows 95, which had no actual security
whatsoever.  Any native code could do anything it wanted.  This situation
persisted, mostly, up to and including Windows XP.  (NT-based kernels
<i>have</i> security, but the average person just ran everything as an
administrator, negating literally all of it.)</p>
<p>So the typical user's operating system provided no strict memory protection
or any other security features.  This is where Java made perfect sense: if
you can provably enforce security at the application layer, you can make a
<i>virtual machine</i> that actually includes these missing security
features, thus making it safe to run random applications on the Internet, and
propelling us into the Internet Age.  Sweet.</p>
<p>Java happened to fail at that, mostly due to slowness and crappiness and
licensing, but the idea was sound, and it was a valiant and worthwhile
effort that deserves our respect even if it didn't work out.  Flash and
Javascript won out in the end because they were somewhat better in some
ways, but they both use VMs (whether interpreted or JITed), and rightly
so.<sup>2</sup></p>
<p>Unfortunately, nowadays the vast majority of Java apps never use any of
Java's security features; they run as apps with full user rights, either on
the client or on the server.  So that advantage of the VM is gone... and the
Java VM has no other advantages.<sup>3</sup>  But people, having been fooled
once, kept going on the path they were already on.</p>
<p>Now ironically, the real problem was not natively compiled languages, but
Windows (or to be generous to Microsoft, "the operating systems at the
time").  Anybody who has studied computer science knows that <b>modern
processors capable of virtual memory were designed around the idea of
keeping untrusted apps under control.</b> Once upon a time, people used to
actually share time on Unix machines.  Lots of people on a few machines. 
And they were largely prevented from stomping on each other.  The
exceptions were security holes - fixable mistakes - and VMs have those too.</p>
<p>It is really not that hard to lock an application into a protected
environment when your processor includes security features.  Just google for
chroot, BSD jail, AppArmor, SELinux.  Yes, some of them are a little
complex, but security is complex; nobody ever claimed Java's security
architecture was <i>simple.</i></p>
<p>Of course, if I had said that five years ago, you might not have believed
me; you might have said those systems weren't secure <i>enough</i>, and that
Java was somehow more secure in ways you couldn't quantify, but that
application-level VM security is just somehow better somehow, I mean look at
the virus situation on Windows.  And I wouldn't be able to argue with you,
because that's not even a logical argument, but it sounds vaguely
convincing.  And so the world went.</p>
<p>Then Apple came along and made the iPhone and its App Store and all the apps
are native and the thing is still secure and apps can't stomp all over the
system.  Again, modulo security holes - fixable mistakes - which VMs don't
eliminate.  Here everybody was, going along with the above illogical
argument in favour of VM security because they couldn't argue with it, and
Apple just ignored them and showed it was <i>all wrong.</i>  You can make
native code secure.  Of course you can.  People did it in the 1980's.  What
on earth were we thinking?</p>
<p>But I'm getting ahead of the story a bit.  Now I've told you why Android's
use of a Java-like VM was demonstrably wrong (Apple demonstrated it) from
the beginning, but first I wanted to tell you why Blackberries use Java, and
lots of old cell phones used Java, and that <i>wasn't</i> obviously wrong.</p>
<p>The reason, of course, is that when Java was first applied to mobile phones,
mobile phones <b>didn't have processors capable of protected memory.</b>
Those processors were <i>really</i> low powered; security was impossible. 
Before Java, you could write custom native apps for a Blackberry... as long
as you gave your source code to RIM to have them review it.  Because native
code could do <i>anything</i>, and there was physically no way to stop it
once it got onto the device.  Other phone manufacturers didn't even bother.</p>
<p>At the time, the first inexpensive embedded processors supporting protected
memory were years in the future.  If you could have a way to safely load
third-party apps onto your phone...  well, wow.  You'd rule the world.  You
wouldn't just have a phone, you'd have a <i>platform</i>.  This was not
silliness, not at all.  A Java VM was the first serious possibility of
making a mobile phone into a serious, flexible, reconfigurable application
platform.</p>
<p>It didn't work out very well, mostly because of Java's slowness and
crappiness and licensing and (in the case of Java ME) horrendous lack of
standardization.  But GMail and Google Maps worked on my Blackberry, and
millions of enterprise Blackberries are deployed running thousands of custom
legacy enterprise apps you've never heard of that will make transitioning
big established companies from Blackberry to iPhone virtually impossible for
many years.  In this case, pure thickheaded brute force did manage to win
the day.</p>
<p>So okay, for the same reason that Java VMs started out as a good idea on
Windows - namely, the platform itself lacked any security features - Java
VMs made sense on phones.  At first.</p>
<p>But embedded processors don't have those limitations anymore.  They're
serious processors now, with protected memory and everything.  Most
importantly, these processors were available and being used from the first
day the first Google Phone was released.  You no longer need a VM for
security... but that means the VM doesn't provide any advantage at
all.<sup>3</sup></p>
<p>The fact that an Android phone has tolerable performance is, again, a
triumph of pure thickheaded brute force.  If you throw enough geniuses at a
difficult technical problem, you might eventually solve that problem, even
if the problem was stupid, and in this case, they mostly did.</p>
<p>But every step of the way, they're going to have this giant anchor of
<strike>UniConf</strike> Dalvik tied around their neck, and Apple won't, and
Apple's native apps will <i>always</i> run faster.  It's going to be
frustrating.</p>
<p>Maybe the speed won't matter.  Maybe computers will get so fast that you
just won't care anymore.</p>
<p>Java users have been saying that, too, since 1996.</p>
<p><b>Footnotes</b></p>
<p><sup>1</sup> I hope</p>
<p><sup>2</sup> Writing native desktop or server applications (ie. ones without
crazy strict security requirements) using a Flash ("Adobe Air") or
Javascript VM is kind of dumb for the same reasons set out in this
article.  There is one redeeming attribute of those systems, however: they
already exist.  If you <i>have</i> to have a VM for security on the web,
then it makes sense to copy the runtime verbatim to the desktop/server, just
because it's easier.  Removing the VM would be possible and very nice, but
it's just an optimization.  Keeping the VM is easier, not harder, and thus
is justifiable.  (This doesn't really apply to Java since it never actually
got popular for web apps.)</p>
<p><sup>3</sup> To pre-emptively refute a few common claims: "Write once run
anywhere" doesn't actually work because the compiler was never the main
problem; differences in OS semantics is the main problem, and you have to
solve those equally for your apps in any language, even Java.  Garbage
collection can be and is frequently done in natively compiled languages. 
Introspection can be done in natively compiled languages.  Digital signing
of shared libraries can be implemented by any native shared library loader. 
Cross-language integration can be and is done <i>all the time</i> in native
languages; in fact, VMs make this much harder, not easier, since now you
have to rewrite all your languages.  Sensible threading primitives (which
some would say Java lacks anyway) can be implemented in any sensible
language, natively compiled or not.  Profile-driven optimization can be done
in compiled languages.  Support for multiple hardware architectures is just
a recompile away - just ask any Mac developer.  Provable memory protection
(including prevention of all attempted null pointer dereferences) is doable
and has been done in statically compiled languages.  And before anyone asks,
no, <a href="http://apenwarr.ca/log/?m=201007#18">C/C++ does not do all
these things</a>; you need a good language.  My point is that the good
language needn't run in a VM; the VM is a red herring, a distraction.</p>
