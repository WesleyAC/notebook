<h1>thoughts</h1>

<p>
thoughts.page is a platform for hosting a small webpage for your thoughts. it's basically like twitter, but nobody can @ you. if you want to see what a thoughts page might look like, check out <a href="https://thoughts.wesleyac.com">my thoughts</a>, <a href="https://evy.garden/thoughts/">evy's thoughts</a>, or <a href="https://thoughts.page/webring">the thoughts webring</a> :)
</p>

<p>
thoughts pages are an attempt at a quieter, slower, more personal internet. a little space on the web, just for you.
</p>

<p>
thoughts.page is free for anyone who makes less than $40,000 USD/year, and costs $5/month otherwise. check out the <a href="/pricing">pricing</a> page for more detail on how this works, and why i've chosen this model.
</p>

<p>
the idea of a thoughts page was originated by <a href="https://linktr.ee/thwidge">maren</a>, who made a <a href="https://github.com/thwidge/thoughts">script</a> for generating thoughts pages. thoughts.page is a way of lowering the barrier of entry to putting thoughts on the internet for people who don't want to or don't know how to set up a script to do it.
