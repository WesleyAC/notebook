Web, he described it as a \"non-linear text system\" for notes. It was designed for scientific researchers and academics to pass around documents that would otherwise be printed on physical paper. The _point_ of the web was to mimic long, text-based, paper documents, but simply make them easier to move around.\n\n\u003c/IntroParagraph\u003e\n\n**Paper documents** were the original metaphor for the web.\n\nIt's no surprise we started with paper. At the moment of the web's conception, computers were objects that lived among white-collar office workers. They were pitched as replacements; they would replace your inbox tray, your trundling filing cabinet, and your little yellow pad of sticky notes. Alan Kay made this cultural context clear when he designed the first [desktop metaphor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_metaphor) at Xerox PARC in the 1970's.\n\n\u003cBasicImage\n  width=\"700\"\n  src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dxj9qr5gj/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto,q_auto:good,w_700/v1643957507/maggieappleton.com/notes/metaphors-we-web-by/The-Desktop-metaphor_1_j1ax5e.png\"\n  alt=\"A screenshot of Magic Cap, an early operating system designed around the desktop metaphor\"\n  showalt\n/\u003e\n\nEver since then, our digital experiences has been structured in terms of dull office equipment. Documents, folders, physical inboxes, rubbish bins, bookmarks, windows, and little yellow stickies are still part of the visual language of our operating systems today.\n\nThinking about computer interfaces as physical office rooms naturally expanded into thinking about the web. Websites were presented as and spoken about as **pages** – as in, _pieces of paper_. We still do it today. We still imagine the web as a series of paper documents with text and images presented on them.\n\nThe surface you're reading this on mimics a long white pape. We still call it a _page_ or an HTML _document_. It follows the same typographic rules and conventions – black text on white backgrounds and a top-to-bottom / left-to-right heirarchical structure.\n\n### The Static Nature of Paper\n\nThis metaphor of _the-web-as-paper_ works quite well. The otherwise immaterial and abstract nature of the web becomes understandable, familiar, and (most importantly) _usable_ through the paper metaphor. We have all seen, handled, and created our own paper documents – a set of understandings we bring to our behaviour on the web.\n\nI should point out that websites and paper do not share any _inherent_ qualities. We purposefully designed webpages to look like paper, but it wasn't some inevitable metaphorical fate.\n\nIn fact, the paper web has some harsh critics. [Ted Nelson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Nelson) is one of the most vocal. As the original creator of _hypertext_ and the visionary [[Project Xanadu]], it's fair to say Ted has spent his life deeply considering the repercussions of design metaphors and literary systems.\n\nIn [**Back to the Future**](https://www.xanadu.net/XanaduSpace/btf.htm): **Hypertext the Way it Used to Be**, Ted argues we've let paper become a metaphorical prison for our digital systems. When we designed digital documents to mimic paper, we unnessecarily brought along many of its physical limitations:\n\n- We treat the page as the smallest unit of linkable information, instead of the sentence or paragraph.\n- We remain married to the conventions of traditional typesetting established by paper printers.\n- We insist on a single view – a mockup of a physical page – rather than embracing the flexible, multiple views possible in a dynamic computational medium.\n\nWorse still, we left behind many of paper's best qualities:\n\n- We took away the right to add handwritten annotation in margins.\n- We took away the ability to lay multiple sheets out in front of us and shuffle them around to find the best structure and sequence.\n- We took away the ability to carry a piece of paper across a room and look it over with someone else.\n\nThis is an inevitable consequence of any design metaphor. Metaphors are designed to _highlight_ qualities that the target concept and the source concept share, and _hide_ qualities they don't. They focus our attention on a particular set of affordances, to the detriment of all others.\n\nThe best solution to this metaphorical concealment is to practice seeing systems in multiple ways. Trying on different metaphorical lenses will change what we think the web is made of, what we think it can do, and its affordances, risks, and restrictions.\n\n## Escaping Paper and Making Space\n\nDespite the persistent metaphor of the paper-based web, we've framed the web in many other ways since its creation. There are many qualities of the web that paper cannot accomodate or conceptually explain; decentralised governance, live connection to other people, dynamic audio-visual creations, and mob-like social congregations have no precedence on paper.\n\nIn searching for metaphors that reflect our experiences, we've called it a [series of tubes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Series_of_tubes), an information superhighway, a surf-able ocean of information, a global village, a town square, and a zero-gravity parallel universe known as _cyberspace_.\n\nOut of all of these metaphors, the second most dominant after paper is **physical space**.\n\nThis is obvious in the way we speak about the web. Our words describe the web as a sprawling expanse of place-based pages – each piece has in it's own location we step into when we **visit** a **homepage**. We **go to** web**sites**. They have a permanent **address** – each URL (uniform resource **locator**) marks its place in digital space. We **follow** links and end up **on** a page, and go **back** to the previous page.\n\n\u003cBasicImage\n  width=\"900px\"\n  src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dxj9qr5gj/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto,q_auto:good,w_900/v1641414096/maggieappleton.com/notes/metaphors-we-web-by/linkedpages_wjh9lh.jpg\"\n  alt=\"Paper documents behind web browsers with IP locations posted above them\"\n/\u003e\n\nOur web browsers play into this narrative of moving through physical space. Netscape **Navigator** helps you find your way around. Internet **Explorer** and **Safari** are a call to adventure in an unknown landscape.\n\nIt didn't take us long to flip the metaphorical script and design our webpages to mimic two-directional maps where you directly clicked on your destination, rather than scrolling a linear paper document. The most infamous being the [Space Jam](https://www.spacejam.com/1996/) design of 1996; all hail.\n\n\u003cImageFrame\n  width=\"800px\"\n  src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dxj9qr5gj/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto,q_auto:good,w_1000/v1643960736/maggieappleton.com/notes/metaphors-we-web-by/spacejam_1_izzfqo.png\"\n  alt=\"A screenshot of the space jam website where a ring of planets surrounds the main space jam logo\"\n/\u003e\n\nThis spatial metaphor intensified as browser technologies advanced. In the early 2000's dynamic programming languages like [Flash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Flash) and [asynchronous JavaScript](\u003chttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_(programming)\u003e) became ubiquitous. These languages enabled us to build instantly interactive websites without requiring page reloads. It became possible to design a webpage as a dynamic space, where clicks, drags, zooms, and pans had immediate effects. Websites began to look less like pages and more like spaces. Games sprung up with characters controlled by arrow keys. Digital whiteboards appeared that you could pan and zoom around like a frame over an infinite canvas.\n\nFor a long time these experiments were rare, exceptional, play-things though. The grain of the web changed faster than we could reconfigure our narratives about it, and we've been slow to realise what this medium is capable of. It is only in recent years we've seen a true flourishing of [spatial interfaces](https://johnpalmer.site/#/spatialinterfaces) that mirror our physical experiences of the world.\n\n### Embodying the Web\n\nMapping our understanding of physical space and direction onto the web was destined in a way that paper was not. Our physical bodies are the primary way we interact the world; we project our understanding of bodies in space onto everything we do. Particularly abstract activites. Politics has governmental _bodies_ with _arms_ of government. Economic indicators go _up_ and _down_, two concepts that require a body in the middle. Time is a line our bodies move along; the future is ahead and the past is behind us. We're looking _forward_ to next week and last year _flew by us_.\n\nThere is no complex, abstract thought that does not require and involve our embodied understanding of being creatures with ups, downs, lefts, rights, ins, outs, ons, offs, and betweens.\n\nThis theory of [embodied cognition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embodied_cognition) – embodiment as essential and central to thinking – has been explored extensively over the last century. Researchers like [Maurice Merleau-Ponty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maurice_Merleau-Ponty), [George Lakoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Lakoff), [Eleanor Rosch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleanor_Rosch), [Barbara Tversky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbara_Tversky), and countless others have revealed how fundamental embodiment is to everything we think, do, and create.\n\nThe web is no exception. The physical and spatial qualities we design into it will always be more salient to us than its paper-ish vibes. The symbolic objects of the 1970's white-collar office is no match for millions of years of primal evolutionary understanding.\n\n### Mixing and Making Metaphors\n\nDespite the common folklore that we shouldn't mix metaphors, we have no problem seeing the web as both paper and place at the same time. It's a classic example of [**conceptual blending**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_blending) \u003cFootnote idName={1}\u003eFor more on Conceptual Blending, see Turner and Fauconnier's \u003ca href=\"https://www.librarything.com/work/249581\"\u003eThe Way We Think\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/Footnote\u003e – the mind's ability to combine multiple metaphors at once and from them produce emergent meaning. We've seamlessly combined the two to create an emergent notion of location-based pages.\n\nAs George Lakoff and Mark Johnson made clear in their touchstone book [Metaphors We Live By](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphors_We_Live_By), metaphors are the basis of all human thought and reasoning. The metaphors we use to speak about the web are not simply linguistic trivia – they determine how we understand it on a fundamental level. It determines what we think the web is capable of, what risks, opportunities, and challenges it poses. Which means the metaphors we use to think about the web **profoundly influence** what we think the web is, what we think we can do with it, and how we might change or evolve it.\n\n## The Web in Geological Layers\n\nThe paper metaphor of the web hides almost everything about how the web works. Paper is a presentation layer. A flat object showing off the final result. Our shiny graphical interfaces offer us a limited range of options pre-selected by designers. They reveal none of the technical processes that cascade across the web when you press seemingly simple buttons like \u003cbutton style={{ background: \"var(--color-bright-crimson)\", color: \"white\", padding: \"0.2rem 0.8rem 0.4rem\", borderRadius: \"4px\", margin: \"0 0.3rem 0 0.3rem\",  lineHeight: \"1.8rem\" }}\u003eSave\u003c/button\u003e \u003cbutton style={{ lineHeight: \"1.8rem\", background: \"var(--color-sea-blue)\", color: \"white\", padding: \"0.2rem 0.8rem 0.4rem\", borderRadius: \"30px\", margin: \"0 0.3rem 0 0\" }}\u003eSend\u003c/button\u003e or \u003cbutton style={{ background: \"var(--color-light-cream)\", border: \"1px solid var(--color-gray-600)\", padding: \"0.2rem 0.8rem 0.4rem\", borderRadius: \"4px\", margin: \"0 0.3rem 0 0\",  lineHeight: \"1.8rem\" }}\u003eSubmit PR Request\u003c/button\u003e\n\nThis is both a feature and a bug.\n\nHow else might we see this system if we move beyond our presentational paper web? Rather than seeing the web as a flat, inert object we passively read, what if we saw the web as an interactive topology made up of various layers?\n\nIf you know anything about how our current web infrastructure came into existence, you're well aware the whole thing is a patchwork of technologies held together with duct tape. It is the furthest thing from a uniform system developed by a centralised team of developers.\n\nEach piece of the modern web was built seperately. Unrelated individuals and teams of developers added layer upon layer. Each one building on top of existing systems, protocols, and standards.\n\nThis geological stack began with Vincent Cern and Robert Kahn establishing the TCP/IP protocol in 1973 – aka. the birth of the internet. That foundation slowly amassed layers like URLs, HTTP, HTML, SMTP, FTP, IMAP, DNS, SSH, REST, and 99 other acronymns. This layered understanding is closer to how developers see a website – as a set of systems they use, connect to, and expand off.\n\n\u003cBasicImage\n  width=\"700px\"\n  src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dxj9qr5gj/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto,q_auto:good,w_700/v1641414096/maggieappleton.com/notes/metaphors-we-web-by/weblayers_bcrfzz.jpg\"\n  alt=\"The web represented as a series of technological layers\"\n/\u003e\n\nWhen you're building a webpage, you're patching together a set of features and affordances.

All of these options touch on different infrastructure layers of the web.\n\nThere's a data layer. There's a security layer. There's a visual design layer. There's a hypertext layer that links to other locations. There's an authentication layer. There's an algorithmic layer.\n\nAlmost all of these layers are completely invisible to \"end users\" of the web. They just see a flat static page. There is no topography. There is no transparency to how this website is structured or built. You don't know what other websites it's connected it, or where it's pulling data in from. The amount of technical literacy you need to even begin to see these layers is non-trivial.\n\n\u003cComingSoon /\u003e\n\n\u003cSpacer size=\"small\" /\u003e\n\n\u003cSubtext\u003e\n  Thanks to the members of the Citizens of Hypertext group for the conversations\n  that sparked many of the ideas in this post.\n\u003c/Subtext\u003e\n","data":{"title":"Metaphors We Web By","description":"A history of our metaphorical understanding of the web","startDate":"2021-10-24","updated":"2022-02-04","type":"essay","topics":["The Web","Design","Metaphors","Linguistics"],"growthStage":"budding","featured":true,"cover":"/images/covers/webmetaphors-cover@2x.png"},"slug":"metaphors-web","filePath":"metaphors-web.mdx"},{"content":"\n\u003cBasicImage\n  alt=\"A browser frame with a small garden growing in front of it.\"\n  width=\"850px\"\n  src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dxj9qr5gj/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto,q_auto:best,w_1000/v1622719121/maggieappleton.com/notes/garden-history/garden-main_ayoaqo_shrink_szbgc7.png\"\n/\u003e\n\n\u003cIntroParagraph\u003e\n\nBack in April of 2020 I put up a long twitter thread on the emerging trend of **Digital Gardening**.

Rather than presenting a set of polished articles, displayed in reverse chronological order, these sites act more like free form, work-in-progress wikis.\n\nA garden is a collection of evolving ideas that aren't strictly organised by their publication date. They're inherently exploratory – notes are linked through contextual associations. They aren't refined or complete - notes are published as half-finished thoughts that will grow and evolve over time. They're less rigid, less performative, and less perfect than the personal websites we're used to seeing.\n\n\u003cBasicImage\n  width=\"1000px\"\n  src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dxj9qr5gj/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto,q_auto:best,w_1000/v1616170717/maggieappleton.com/notes/garden-history/growth-leaves_gtdalf.png\"\n/\u003e\n\nIt harkens back to the early days of the web when people had fewer notions of how websites \"_should be_.\" It's an ethos that is both classically old and newly imagined.\n\n---\n\n# A Brief History of Digital Gardens\n\nLet's go on a short journey to the origin of this word. The notion of a _digital garden_ is not a 2020 invention. It's been floating around for over two decades. However, it's passed through a couple of semantic shifts in that time, meaning different things to different people across the years. As words tend to do.\n\nTracing back how [[Neologisms]] are born helps us understand why anyone needed this word in the first place. Language is always a response to the evolving world around us – we expand it when our current vocabulary fails to capture what we're observing, or have a particular desire for how we'd like the future to unfold. Naming is a political act as much as a poetic one.\n\n## The Early Gardens of Hypertext\n\nMark Bernstein's 1998 essay \u003ca href=\"http://www.eastgate.com/garden/Enter.html\"\u003eHypertext Gardens\u003c/a\u003e appears to be the first recorded mention of the term. Mark was part of the early hypertext crowd – the developers figuring out how to arrange and present this new medium.\n\nWhile the essay is a beautiful ode to free-wheeling internet exploration, it's less about building personal internet spaces, and more of a manifesto on user experience flows and content organisation.\n\n\u003cTwoColumn\u003e\n\n\u003cimg\n  alt=\"A screenshot of Mark Bernstein's 1998 essay\"\n  src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dxj9qr5gj/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto,q_auto:best,w_800/v1614174712/maggieappleton.com/notes/garden-history/Hypertext_Gardens_fsudk6.png\"\n/\u003e\n\n\u003cimg\n  alt=\"A screenshot of Mark Bernstein's 1998 essay\"\n  src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dxj9qr5gj/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto,q_auto:best,w_800/v1614174705/maggieappleton.com/notes/garden-history/Gardens_and_Paths_g0wfdw.png\"\n/\u003e\n\n\u003cimg\n  alt=\"A screenshot of Mark Bernstein's 1998 essay\"\n  src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dxj9qr5gj/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto,q_auto:best,w_800/v1614174707/maggieappleton.com/notes/garden-history/Seven_Lessons_dng4bf.png\"\n/\u003e\n\n\u003cimg\n  alt=\"A screenshot of Mark Bernstein's 1998 essay\"\n  src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dxj9qr5gj/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto,q_auto:best,w_800/v1614174712/maggieappleton.com/notes/garden-history/Establishing_Order_t1phoe.png\"\n/\u003e\n\n\u003c/TwoColumn\u003e\n\n\u003cSubtext\u003eLet's note that Mark's graphics are to die for\u003c/Subtext\u003e\n\nTo put this in its historical context, Mark's writing was part of a larger conversation happening throughout the nineties around hypertext and its metaphorical framing.\n\nThe early web-adopters were caught up in the idea of The Web as a labyrinth-esque community landscape tended by \u003ca href=\"https://wiki.c2.com/?WikiGardener\"\u003eWikiGardeners\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://wiki.c2.com/?WikiGnome\"\u003eWikiGnomes.\u003c/a\u003e\u003cFootnote idName={1}\u003eThe caretaking roles given to people who cleaned up broken links, attributions, and awkward white space on shared wiki websites.\u003c/Footnote\u003e\nThese creators wanted to enable pick-your-own-path experiences, while also providing enough signposts that people didn't feel lost in their new, strange medium.\n\nThe early web debates around this became known as \u003ca href=\"https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-55991-4_31\"\u003e_The Navigation Problem_\u003c/a\u003e – the issue of how to give web users just enough guidance to freely explore the web, without forcing them into pre-defined browsing experiences. The eternal struggle to find the right balance of chaos and structure.\n\n\u003e \"Unplanned hypertext sprawl is wilderness: complex and interesting, but uninviting. Interesting things await us in the thickets, but we may be reluctant to plough through the brush, subject to thorns and mosquitoes\"\n\nWhile Mark's essay was concerned with different problems to the ones we face on the web today, its core ethos feels aligned with our emerging understanding of digital gardening. It captures the desire for exploratory experiences, a welcoming of digital weirdness, and a healthy amount of resistance to top-down structures.\n\nAfter Mark's essay the term **digital gardening** goes quiet for nearly a decade.\n\n---\n\n## Digital Puttering on Twitter\n\nIn April of 2007 when Tweets first started ringing through the internet airwaves, Rory Sutherland (oddly, the vice president of Ogilvy Group) used the term \"**digital gardening**\", but defined it as _\"faffing about syncing things, defragging - like pruning for young people\"_ \u003cFootnote idName={2}\u003eFor those from outside the Commonwealth, \"faffing\" means mucking about without a clear direction or useful output\u003c/Footnote\u003e\n\n\u003cTweetEmbed tweetId=\"34981652\" /\u003e\n\nThe next dozen mentions on Twitter all followed this sentiment – people were using the term as a way to describe **digital maintenance** - **the act of cleaning up one's digital space**. The focus was on sorting, weeding, pruning, and decluttering, rather than growing and cultivating. People mentioned cleaning out private folders, codebases, and photo albums as the focus of their gardening efforts.\n\nThese people were **digital puttering** more than gardening.\n\n\u003cTweetEmbed tweetId=\"1616935301\" /\u003e\n\n\u003cTweetEmbed tweetId=\"10102084267\" /\u003e\n\n\u003cTweetEmbed tweetId=\"40614201554640896\" /\u003e\n\nSince none of these folks reference to the earlier nineties notion of **digital gardening**, or mention issues of hypertext navigation, this use of the word feels like a brief tangent. Given the tiny size of Twitter in the early days, these people probably belonged to the same social flocks and were riffing off one another. It's not necessarily part of the mainstream narrative we're tracking, but shows there's not one strict meaning to the term.\n\nThat said, some degree of faffing about, sorting, and pruning are certainly part of the practice of digital gardening. Though best enjoyed in moderation.\n\n---\n\n## Gardens, Streams, and Caufield's Metaphors\n\nAt the 2015 Digital Learning Research Network, Mike Caufield delivered a keynote on \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckv_CjyKyZY\u0026feature=emb_logo\"\u003eThe Garden and the Stream: a Technopastoral\u003c/a\u003e. It later becomes \u003ca href=\"https://hapgood.us/2015/10/17/the-garden-and-the-stream-a-technopastoral/\"\u003ea hefty essay\u003c/a\u003e that lays the foundations for our current understanding of the term. **If anyone should be considered the original source of _digital gardening_, it's Caufield.** They are the first to lay out this whole idea in poetic, coherent words.\n\nCaufield makes clear digital gardening is not about specific tools – it's not a Wordpress plugin, Gastby theme, or Jekyll template. It's a **different way of thinking about our online behaviour around information** - one that accumulates personal knowledge over time in an explorable space.\n\nCaufield's main argument was that we have become swept away by _streams_ – the collapse of information into single-track timelines of events. The conversational feed design of email inboxes, group chats, and InstaTwitBook is fleeting – they're only concerned with self-assertive immediate thoughts that rush by us in a few moments. \u003cFootnote idName={3}\u003eWhile this may sound obvious now, the streamification of everything was still dawning around 2015.\u003c/Footnote\u003e\n\nThis is not inherently bad. Streams have their time and place. Twitter is a force-multiplier for exploratory thoughts and delightful encounters once you fall in with the right crowd and learn to play the game.\n\nBut streams only surface the Zetigeisty ideas of the last 24 hours. They are not designed to accumulate knowledge, connect disparate information, or mature over time. \u003cFootnote idName={4}\u003eThough the rising popularity of \u003ca href=\"https://aaronzlewis.com/blog/2019/05/01/spreading-threading/\"\u003eTwitter threading\u003c/a\u003e is an impressive attempt to reconfigure a stream environment and make it more garden-esque.\u003c/Footnote\u003e\n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\nThe _garden_ is our counterbalance. **Gardens present information in a richly linked landscape that grows slowly over time.** Everything is arranged and connected in ways that allow you to explore. Think about the way Wikipedia works when you're hopping from [Bolshevism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolshevism) to [Celestial Mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celestial_mechanics) to [Dunbar's Number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar%27s_number). It's hyperlinking at it's best. You get to actively choose which curiosity trail to follow, rather than defaulting to the algorithmically-filtered ephemeral stream. **The garden helps us move away from time-bound streams and into contextual knowledge spaces.**\n\n\u003e \"The Garden is the web as topology. The web as space. It’s the integrative web, the iterative web, the web as an arrangement and rearrangement of things to one another.\"\n\n### Carrying on Caufield\n\nGood ideas take time to germinate, and Caufield's vision of the personal garden didn't reach critical mass right off the bat. It lay dormant, waiting for the right time and the right people to find it.\n\nIn late 2018 the corner of Twitter I hang out in began using the term more regularly – folks began passing around Caufield's original article and experimenting with ways to turn their chronological blogs into exploratory, interlinked gardens.\n\nTom Critchlow's 2018 article [Of Digital Streams, Campfires and Gardens](https://tomcritchlow.com/2018/10/10/of-gardens-and-wikis/) was one of the main kick-off points. Tom read Caufield's essay and began speculating on alternative metaphors to frame the way we consume and produce information. They suggested we add _campfires_ to the idea of streams and gardens – the private Slack groups, casual blog rings, and [[Cozy Web]] areas where people write in response to one another. While gardens present the ideas of an individual, campfires are conversational spaces to exchange ideas that aren't yet fully formed.\n\nTom piece was shortly followed by Joel Hooks' [My blog is a digital garden, not a blog](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden) in early 2019. \u003cFootnote idName={5}\u003eDisclaimer that Joel is a mentor, collaborator and friend, so my exposure to the idea comes from his early advocacy and enthusiasm for it.\u003c/Footnote\u003e Joel focused on the _process_ of digital gardening, emphasising the slow growth of ideas through writing, rewriting, editing, and revising thoughts in public. Instead of slapping Fully Formed Opinions up on the web and never changing them.\n\nJoel also added Amy Hoy's [How the Blog Broke the Web](https://stackingthebricks.com/how-blogs-broke-the-web/) post to the pile of influential ideas that led to our current gardening infatuation. While not specifically about gardening, Amy's piece gives us a lot of good historical context. In it, she explores the history of blogs over the last three decades, and pinpoints exactly when we all became fixated on publishing our thoughts in reverse chronological order (spoiler: around 2001 with the launch of [Moveable Type](https://www.movabletype.org/)).\n\nAmy argues that Moveable Type didn't just launch us into the \"**Chronological Sort Era**\". It also killed the wild, diverse, hodge-podge personalisation of websites that characterised the early web. Instead of hand-coding your own layout and deciding exactly how to arrange the digital furniture, we began to enter the age of standardised layouts. Plug n' play templates that you drop content into became the norm. It became harder and more technically involved to edit the HTML \u0026 CSS yourself.\n\n\u003e \"Suddenly people weren’t creating homepages or even web pages... they were writing web content in form fields and text areas inside a web page.\"\n\nMany people have lamented the web's slow transition from unique homepages to a bland ocean of generic Wordpress themes. Digital gardening is part of the pushback against the limited range of vanilla web formats and layouts we now for granted.\n\nOver the course 2019 and early 2020, more and more people began riffing on the concept. Shaun Wang compiled the [Digital Gardening Terms of Service](https://www.swyx.io/digital-garden-tos/). Anne-Laure Le Cunff published a popular guide to setting up [No-code Digital Gardens](https://nesslabs.com/digital-garden-set-up). The IndieWeb community hosted a [pop-up session](https://indieweb.org/2020/Pop-ups/GardenAndStream) to discuss the history of commonplace books, personal wikis, and memory palaces.\n\nBy late 2020 this whole concept had attracted enough attention for the MIT Tech Review to write [a short piece](https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/09/03/1007716/digital-gardens-let-you-cultivate-your-own-little-bit-of-the-internet/) on it. Perhaps this is the watershed moment when a Twitter buzzword has \"made it.\"\n\n\u003cImageFrame\n  width=\"1100px\"\n  src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dxj9qr5gj/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto,q_auto:best,w_1200/v1622719057/maggieappleton.com/notes/garden-history/mit-gardens_shrink_vpgbsl.png\"\n  showalt\n  alt=\"A feature about digital gardening on MIT's tech review\"\n/\u003e\n\n---\n\n## Digital Gardening's Fertile Soil\n\nWhat made our current historical moment the right time for digital gardening to take off?\n\nThe timing coincided with a few complimentary ideas and communities rallying around personal knowledge systems, note-taking practices, and reimagining tools for blogging. The scene was ripe for new ideas around curating and sharing personal knowledge online.\n\nMany of the people who jumped on the early digital gardening bandwagon were part of communities like...\n\n- The [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org/) collective – a group that has been championing independent web spaces outside the walled gardens of Instatwitbook for nearly a decade.\n- Users of the note-taking app [Roam Research](https://roamresearch.com/) – Roam pioneered new ways of interlinking content and strongly appeals to people trying to build sprawling knowledge graphs.\n- Followers of Tiago Forte's [Building a Second Brain](https://www.buildingasecondbrain.com/) course which popularised the idea of actively curating personal knowledge.\n- People rallying around the [Learn in Public](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public/) ethos that encourages continuously creating 'learning exhaust' in the form of notes and summaries.\n\n### Developer-led Gardening\n\nMany of these early adopters were people who understood how to build websites – either professional developers or enthusiastic hobbyists. Any kind of novel experimentation with the web requires knowing a non-trivial amount of HTML, CSS, and JS. Not to mention all the surrounding infrastructure required actually to get a site live. Developers took to the idea because they already had the technical ability to jump in play around with what garden-esque websites might look like.\n\nThe current state of web development helped here too. While it feels like we've been in a slow descent into a horrifyingly complex and bloated web development process, a number of recent tools have made it easier to get a fully customised website up and running. Services like [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) and [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) have taken the pain out of deployment. Static site generators like [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/), [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) and [Next](https://nextjs.org/) make it easier to build sophisticated websites that auto-generate pages, and take care of grunt work like optimising load time, images, and SEO. \u003cFootnote idName={6}\u003ePlenty of people will disagree that this explosion of JavaScript-stuffed rubbish is a net gain for the web. We all lament the loss of being able to upload pure HTML and CSS files via FTP. But those days are gone, and the only thing we can do now is slowly untangle our JavaScript spaghetti and package it up into more accessible build tools.\u003c/Footnote\u003e These services are trying to find a happy middle ground between tediously hand-coding solutions, and being trapped in the restrictions of Wordpress or Squarespace.\n\nWhile developers were the first on the scene, plenty of writers, researchers, and note-taking enthusiasts have been drawn to the idea of digital gardening.\nTo help folks without programming skills join in, there's been a surge in templates and platforms that allow people to build their own digital gardens without touching a ton of code. I've written an entire guide to [[Digital Gardening for Non-Technical Folks]] if you fall into that category.\n\nTools like [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), [TiddlyWiki](https://tiddlywiki.com/), and [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) are all great options. Many of them offer fancy features like nested folders, [[Bi-Directional Links]], footnotes, and visual graphs.\n\nHowever, many of these no-code tools still feel like cookie-cutter solutions. Rather than allowing people to design the [information architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_architecture) and spatial layouts of their gardens, they inevitably force people into pre-made arrangements. This doesn't meant they don't \"count,\" as \"real\" gardens, but simply that they limit their gardeners to some extent. You can't design different types of links, novel features, experimental layouts, or custom architecture. They're pre-fab houses instead of raw building materials.\n\n---\n\n## The Six Patterns of Gardening\n\nIn all the recent gardening flurry, we've run into the inevitable confusion around how to define the term.\n\n\u003cTweetEmbed tweetId=\"1260368292851535879\" /\u003e\n\nThere are contested ideas about what qualifies as a garden, what the core ethos should focus on, and whether it's worthy of a new label at all. What exactly makes a website a _digital garden_ as opposed to just another blog?\n\nAfter reading all the existing takes on the term, observing a wide variety of gardens, and collecting some of the [best examples](https://github.com/MaggieAppleton/digital-gardeners), I've identified a few key qualities they all share.\n\nThere are a few guiding principles, design patterns and structures people are rallying around. This amounts to a kind of digital gardening [[Pattern Language]].\n\n\u003cSpacer size=\"small\" /\u003e\n\n### 1. Topography over Timelines\n\nGardens are organised around **contextual relationships and associative links**; the concepts and themes within each note determine how it's connected to others.\n\nThis runs counter to the time-based structure of traditional blogs: posts presented in reverse chronological order based on publication date.\n\nGardens don't consider publication dates the most important detail of a piece of writing. Dates might be included on posts, but they aren't the structural basis of how you navigate around the garden. Posts are connected to other by posts through related themes, topics, and shared context.\n\nOne of the best ways to do this is through [[Bi-Directional Links]] – links that make both the destination page and the source page visible to the reader. This makes it easy to move between related content.\n\n\u003cBasicImage\n  width=\"900px\"\n  alt=\"A linear timeline of posts vs. a spatial layout of connected posts\"\n  src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dxj9qr5gj/image/upload/v1621774501/maggieappleton.com/notes/garden-history/topographytimelines_shrink_jxgw9l.png\"\n/\u003e\n\nBecause garden notes are densely linked, a garden explorer can enter at any location and follow any trail they link through the content, rather than being dumped into a \"most recent\" feed.\n\nDense links are essential, but gardeners often layer on other ways of exploring their knowledge base. They might have [thematic piles](https://busterbenson.com/piles/), [nested folders](https://tomcritchlow.com/wiki/), tags and filtering functionality, [advanced search bars](https://www.christopherbiscardi.com/garden), [visual node graphs](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/), or [central indexes](https://www.gwern.net/index) listing notable and popular content.\n\nMany entry points but no prescribed pathways.\n\n\u003cSpacer /\u003e\n\n### 2. Continuous Growth\n\nGardens are never finished, they're **constantly growing, evolving, and changing**. Just like a real soil, carrot, and cabbage garden.\n\nThe isn't how we usually think about writing on the web. Over the last decade, we've moved away from casual live journal entries and formalised our writing into _articles_ and _essays_. These are carefully crafted, edited, revised, and published with a timestamp. When it's done, it's done. We act like tiny magazines, sending our writing off to the printer.\n\nThis is odd considering editability is one of the main selling points of the web. Gardens lean into this – there is no \"final version\" on a garden. What you publish is always open to revision and expansion. \u003cFootnote idName={7}\u003eOr more likely, contraction and clarification\u003c/Footnote\u003e\n\nGardens are designed to evolve alongside your thoughts. When you first have an idea, it's fuzzy and unrefined. You might notice a pattern in your corner of the world, but need to collect evidence, consider counter-arguments, spot similar trends, and research who else has thunk such thoughts before you. In short, you need to do your homework and critically think about it over time.\n\n\u003cBasicImage\n  width=\"950px\"\n  src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dxj9qr5gj/image/upload/v1621773885/maggieappleton.com/notes/garden-history/gardentime_rrsecv.png\"\n  alt=\"A graph of time versus amount of work. Gardening involves small amounts of work over time, while classic blogging involves a lot of work all at once.\"\n/\u003e\n\nIn performance-blog-land you do that thinking and researching privately, then shove it out at the final moment. A grand flourish that hides the process.\n\nIn garden-land, that process of researching and refining happens on the open internet. You post ideas while they're still \"seedlings,\" and tend them regularly until they're fully grown, respectable opinions.\n\nThis has a number of benefits:\n\n- You're freed from the pressure to get everything right immediately. You can test ideas, get feedback, and revise your opinions like a good internet citizen.\n- It's _low friction_. Gardening your thoughts becomes a daily ritual that only takes a small amount of effort. Over time, big things grow.\n- It gives readers an insight into your writing and thinking process. They come to realise you are not a magical idea machine banging out perfectly formed thoughts, but instead an equally mediocre human doing The Work of trying to understand the world and make sense of it alongside you.\n\nThis all comes with an important caveat; **gardens make their imperfection known to readers**. Which brings us to the next pattern...\n\n\u003cSpacer /\u003e\n\n### 3. Imperfection \u0026 Learning in Public\n\nGardens are **imperfect by design**. They don't hide their rough edges or claim to be a permanent source of truth.\n\nPutting anything imperfect and half-written on an \"official website\" may feel strange. \u003cFootnote idName={8}\u003eWe seem to reserve all our imperfect declarations and poorly-worded announcements for platforms that other people own and control.\u003c/Footnote\u003e We have all been trained to behave like tiny, performative corporations when it comes to presenting ourselves in digital space. Blogging evolved in the [Premium Mediocre](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2017/08/17/the-premium-mediocre-life-of-maya-millennial/) culture of Millenialism as a way to Promote Your Personal Brand™ and market your SEO-optimized Content.\n\nWeird, quirky personal blogs of the early 2000's turned into cleanly crafted brands with publishing strategies and media campaigns. Everyone now has a modern minimalist logo and an LLC.\n\nDigital gardening is the [Domestic Cozy](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/series/domestic-cozy/) response to the professional personal blog; it's both intimate and public, weird and welcoming. It's less performative than a blog, but more intentional and thoughtful than a Twitter feed. It wants to build personal knowledge over time, rather than engage in banter and quippy conversations.\n\nThink of it as a spectrum. Things we dump into private WhatsApp group chats, DMs, and cavalier Tweet threads are part of our _chaos streams_ - a continuous flow of high noise / low signal ideas. On the other end we have highly performative and cultivated artefacts like published books that you prune and tend for years.\n\nGardening sits in the middle. It's the perfect balance of chaos and cultivation.\n\n\u003cBasicImage\n  width=\"1000px\"\n  alt=\"a spectrum of knowledge management, ranging from chaos streams to the cultivated performance of publishing a book. Gardening sits in the middle.\"\n  src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dg3gyk0gu/image/upload/c_scale,w_1600/v1593765637/maggieappleton.com/notes/garden-history/digital-garden.png\"\n/\u003e\n\nThis ethos of imperfection opens up a world of possibility that performative blogging shut down. First, it enables you to [Learn in Public](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public/); the practice of sharing what you learn as you're learning it, not a decade later once you're an \"expert.\" \u003cFootnote idName={9}\u003eA label you may never officially earn unless you're in a highly structured and bureaucratised industry that loves explicit hierarchy rankings. The rest of us are left to deal with perpetual imposter syndrome.\u003c/Footnote\u003e\n\nThis freedom of course comes with great responsibility. Publishing imperfect and early ideas **requires that we make the status of our notes clear to readers.** You should include some indicator of how \"done\" they are, and how much effort you've invested in them.\n\nThis could be with a simple categorisation system. I personally use an overly horticultural metaphor:\n\n- 🌱 _Seedlings_ for very rough and early ideas\n- 🌿 _Budding_ for work I've cleaned up and clarified\n- 🌳 _Evergreen_ for work that is reasonably complete (though I still tend these over time).\n\nI also include the dates I _planted_ and _last tended_ a post so people get a sense of how long I've been growing it.\n\n\u003cImageFrame\n  width=\"900px\"\n  src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dxj9qr5gj/image/upload/v1621931871/maggieappleton.com/notes/garden-history/metadata_jtz6od.png\"\n  alt=\"The metadata at the top of my posts showing growth stage\"\n/\u003e\n\nOther gardeners include an **epistemic status** on their posts – a short statement that makes clear how they know what they know, and how much time they've invested in researching it.\n\n[Gwern.net](https://www.gwern.net/index) was one of the earliest and most consistent gardeners to offer meta-reflections on their work.\nEach entry comes with:\n\n- topic tags\n- start and end date\n- a stage tag: _draft_, _in progress_, or _finished_\n- a certainty tag: _impossible_, _unlikely_, _certain_, etc.\n- 1-10 importance tag\n\nThese are all explained in their [website guide](https://www.gwern.net/About#confidence-tags), which is worth reading if you're designing your own epistemological system.\n\n\u003cImageFrame\n  width=\"900px\"\n  src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dxj9qr5gj/image/upload/v1621499882/maggieappleton.com/notes/garden-history/Screenshot_-_2021-05-20_09.35.37_shrink_x79dnz.png\"\n  showalt\n  alt=\"The metadata avaliable on each of Gwern's essays\"\n/\u003e\n\nDevon Zuegal is another notable gardener who has _epistemic status_ and _epistemic effort_ on their posts, indicating both their certainty level about the material, and how much effort went into making it. They also make a strong case for [lazy epistemic statuses](https://devonzuegel.com/post/epistemic-statuses-are-lazy-and-that-is-a-good-thing) as a feature, not a bug.\n\n\u003cImageFrame\n  width=\"900px\"\n  src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dxj9qr5gj/image/upload/v1621838735/maggieappleton.com/notes/garden-history/Screenshot_-_2021-05-24_07.44.48_shrink_rg7rec.png\"\n  alt=\"Epistemic effort and epistemic status metadata at the top of Devon Zuegal's writing\"\n  showalt\n/\u003e\n\nIn a similar vein, Shawn Wang has written the Digital Gardening [Terms of Service](https://www.swyx.io/digital-garden-tos) which I adore and ascribe to. They ask the reader to allow the writer to be wrong, offer constructive criticism, and attribute their work. They ask gardeners to be considerate of others (don't share private information or name and shame), offer epistemic disclosure, and respond to feedback.\n\n\u003cimg\n  width=\"900px\"\n  src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6764957/75324412-e3bc2480-5844-11ea-90be-4a26b6a64000.png\"\n  alt=\"The digital gardening terms of service – Source: Shawn Wang, swyx.io\"\n  showalt\n/\u003e\n\nAll of these design patterns feed our growing desire for transparency, meta information, and breadcrumbs back to the source of ideas.\n\n\u003cSpacer /\u003e\n\n### 4. Playful, Personal, and Experimental\n\nGardens are non-homogenous by nature. You can plant the same seeds as your neighbour, but you'll always end up with a different arrangement of plants.\n\nDigital gardens should be just as unique and particular as their vegetative counterparts. The point of a garden is that it's a personal playspace. You organise the garden around the ideas and mediums that match your way of thinking, rather than off someone else's standardised template.\n\n\u003cBasicImage\n  width=\"900px\"\n  alt=\"A row of four plants where three look identical and one is wild and different\"\n  src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dg3gyk0gu/image/upload/v1609617065/maggieappleton.com/notes/garden-history/unique-gardens_shrink.png\"\n/\u003e\n\nIdeally, this involves experimenting with the native languages of the web – HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. They're the most flexible and robust tools we have for building interconnected knowledge online. Gardens are a chance to question the established norms of a '_personal website_', and make space for weirder, wilder experiments.\n\nThat said, I should acknowledge that jumping into full-on web development is simply beyond the abilities and interests of many people. There is still room for personalisation and play if you're using a pre-made template or service – it'll just be within the constraints of that system.\n\nOne goal of these hyper-personalised gardens is deep **contextualisation**. The overwhelming lesson of the Web 2.0 social media age is that dumping millions of people together into decontextualised social spaces is a shit show. Devoid of any established social norms and abstracted from our specific cultural identities, we end up in awkward, aggravating exchanges with people who are socially incoherent to us. We know nothing of their lives, backgrounds, or belief systems, and have to assume the worst. Twitter only offers us a 240 character bio. Facebook pre-selects the categories it deems important about you – relationship status, gender, hometown.\n\nGardens offer us the ability to present ourselves in forms that aren't cookie cutter profiles. They're the higher-fidelity version, complete with quirks, contradictions, and complexity.\n\n\u003cSpacer size=\"small\" /\u003e\n\n### 5. Intercropping \u0026 Content Diversity\n\nGardens are not just a collection of interlinked words. While linear writing is an incredible medium that has served us well for a little over 5000 years, it is daft to pretend working in a single medium is a sufficient way to explore complex ideas.\n\nIt is also absurd to ignore the fact we're living in an audio-visual cornucopia that the web makes possible. Podcasts, videos, diagrams, illustrations, interactive web animations, academic papers, tweets, rough sketches, and code snippets should all live and grow in the garden.\n\n\u003cimg\n  width=\"800px\"\n  src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dxj9qr5gj/image/upload/v1621781288/maggieappleton.com/notes/garden-history/intercropping-garden_shrink_mx6nx8.png\"\n/\u003e\n\nHistorically, monocropping has been the quickest route to starvation, pests, and famine. Don't be a lumper potato farmer while everyone else is sustainably intercropping.\n\n\u003cSpacer size=\"small\" /\u003e\n\n### 6. Independent Ownership\n\nGardening is about claiming a small patch of the web for yourself, one you fully own and control.\n\nThis patch should not live on the servers of Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, Instagram (aka. also Facebook), or Medium. None of these platforms are designed to help you slowly build and weave personal knowledge. Most of them actively fight against it.\n\nIf any of those services go under, your writing and creations sink with it (crazier things have happened in the span of humanity). None of them have an easy export button. And they certainly won't hand you your data in a transferable format.\n\n\u003cimg\n  width=\"880px\"\n  src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dxj9qr5gj/image/upload/v1622210536/maggieappleton.com/notes/garden-history/interoperable_shrink_vmtvx6.png\"\n  alt=\"A set of walled gardens with the Twitter, Medium, and Facebook logos next to an open garden built on HTML, CSS, and Markdown\"\n/\u003e\n\nIndependently owning your garden helps you plan for long-term change. You should think about how you want your space to grow over the next few decades, not just the next few months.\n\nIf you give it a bit of forethought, you can build your garden in a way that makes it easy to transfer and adapt. Platforms and technologies will inevitably change. Using old-school, reliable, and widely used web native formats like HTML/CSS is a safe bet. Backing up your notes as flat markdown files won't hurt either.\n\nKeeping your garden on the open web also sets you up to take part in the future of gardening. At the moment our gardens are rather solo affairs. We haven't figure out how to make them multi-player. _But_ there's an enthusiastic community of developers and designers trying to fix that. It's hard to say what kind of libraries, frameworks, and design patterns might emerge out of that effort, but it certainly isn't going to happen behind a Medium paywall.\n\n\u003cimg\n  width=\"920px\"\n  src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dxj9qr5gj/image/upload/v1622210536/maggieappleton.com/notes/garden-history/shared-gardens_shrink_xin7qm.png\"\n  alt=\"A set of gardens with plant life moving between them\"\n/\u003e\n\n---\n\nThis is all my take on gardening, but knowledge and neologisms always live within communities. No one owns _The Official Definition_ of digital gardening. Numerous people have contributed to the growing conversation and you should read their thoughts as well.\n\n\u003cReferences\u003e\n\n\u003cReferencesLink\n  title=\"The Garden and the Stream: A Technopastoral\n\"\n  author=\"Mike Caulfield\"\n  href=\"https://hapgood.us/2015/10/17/the-garden-and-the-stream-a-technopastoral/\"\n/\u003e\n\n\u003cReferencesLink\n  title=\"My blog is a digital garden, not a blog\"\n  author=\"Joel Hooks\"\n  href=\"https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden\"\n/\u003e\n\n\u003cReferencesLink\n  title=\"Of Digital Streams, Campfires and Gardens\n\"\n  author=\"Tom Critchlow\"\n  href=\"https://tomcritchlow.com/2018/10/10/of-gardens-and-wikis/\"\n/\u003e\n\n\u003cReferencesLink\n  title=\"How the Blog Broke the Web\"\n  author=\"Amy Hoy\"\n  href=\"https://stackingthebricks.com/how-blogs-broke-the-web/\"\n/\u003e\n\n\u003cReferencesLink\n  title=\"You and your mind garden\"\n  author=\"Anne-Laure Le Cunff\"\n  href=\"https://nesslabs.com/mind-garden\"\n/\u003e\n\n\u003cReferencesLink\n  title=\"Digital Gardening Terms of Service\"\n  author=\"Shawn Wang\"\n  href=\"https://www.swyx.io/writing/digital-garden-tos/\"\n/\u003e\n\n\u003cReferencesLink\n  title=\"The Future of MDX and Digital Gardening Panel\"\n  author=\"Joel Hooks, Chris Biscardi, John Otander, and Kurt Kemple\"\n  href=\"https://egghead.io/lessons/egghead-sector-the-future-of-mdx-and-digital-gardens\"\n/\u003e\n\n\u003c/References\u003e\n","data":{"title":"A Brief History \u0026 Ethos of the Digital Garden","description":"A newly revived philosophy for publishing personal knowledge on the web","aliases":["Digital Gardeners","Digital Gardening","Digital Gardens","Digital Garden","History and Ethos of Digital Gardening"],"startDate":"2020-06-10","updated":"2021-05-28","featured":true,"cover":"/images/covers/garden-cover@2x.png","type":"essay","topics":["Digital Gardening","The Web"],"growthStage":"evergreen"},"slug":"garden-history","filePath":"garden-history.mdx"},{"content":"\n\u003cAssumedAudience\u003e\n\nDevelopers interested in design and illustration.

Lovely folks like \u003ca href=\"https://dribbble.com/maximebourgeois\"\u003eMaxime\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://dribbble.com/Aleksandr_Ageev\"\u003eAleksander\u003c/a\u003e have made plenty of them.\u003c/Footnote\u003e\n\n---\n\n## Part Zero – What are we doing?\n\nThe guinea pig for this case study is going to be \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/mikesherov\"\u003eMike Sherov\u003c/a\u003e's course on \u003ca href=\"https://egghead.io/courses/web-security-essentials?af=54fd64\"\u003eWeb Security Essentials\u003c/a\u003e.\n\nHere's a quick overview of the course – it shows you how to protect a website against common attacks like man-in-the-middle interceptions, cross-site scripting, and cookie hijacking. All your classic internet foes.\n\nThe first step in starting a design task of any kind – illustration, innovative sandwich recipe, or carbon capture technology – is making the challenge you're facing nice and clear. So let's write ourselves a challenge statement:\n\n\u003e Create an illustration that clearly communicates the idea of \"Web Security\"\n\nThat might seem dumb and obvious, but it's surprising how easy it is to get off track without stating the goal up front.\n\nAt this point, it's good to make clear that _\"Web Security\"_ is not a single, physical, made-of-atoms-and-quarks object in the world.\n\nThus begins our problem.\n\n### How do you draw a thing that's not a thing?\n\nIt's a good question.\nOne I'm slightly obsessed with.\n\nDrawing well is difficult in its own right. Making a dog look like a dog or hand look like a hand requires a lot of training, practice and patience.\nIt's a whole extra challenge to figure out what the _thing_ you're going to draw is in the first place.\n\nHow do you take a fuzzy-edged, evolving cultural concept like \"Web Security,\" and condense it down to a single image?\n\nThe answer, in short, is a mix of **cultural symbols** and **visual metaphor**. Though there's a little more to it than that.\n\nGood, meaningful illustration works in four layers.  \nI like to think of it as a cake:\n\n\u003cBasicImage\n  width=\"850px\"\n  alt=\"Illustration of a layered cake with four tiers. The bottom is meaningful visual metaphor, next is clear, well constructed drawing, third is a nicely designed composition, and the top is fancy lighting and pretty colors.

Add on a layer of clear, well-constructed drawing. Then you think about designing an aesthetically pleasing composition with \u003ca href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/03/design-principles-visual-perception-and-the-principles-of-gestalt/\"\u003egestalt principals\u003c/a\u003e. And finally you throw fancy lighting and pretty colors over the top. \u003cFootnote idName={2}\u003eNot an official theory of any sort - just IMHO. Feel free to email this to real illustration professors and PhD students so they can burn it on the sacrificial cross of correctness\u003c/Footnote\u003e\n\n### Tool Talk\n\nA whole lot of people ask about the whipped cream and cherries sitting at the very top of that cake.\n\n\u003e \"What app is that?\"\n\nThis happens in every industry – the most visible top layer of any creation feels like the most important part of it. Asking what tool someone uses is a very logical and legitimate question.\n\nSo let's get the tool talk out of the way. I've written a [whole post](apps)talking about the hardware/software I use for various illustration styles. But here's the quick version:\n\n\u003cBasicImage\n  width=\"840px\"\n  alt=\"Photos of a macbook pro, a cintiq drawing tablet, an ipad pro, and the app logos for procreate, illustrator, and photoshop\"\n  src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dxj9qr5gj/image/upload/v1632316506/maggieappleton.com/essays/drawing-invisibles/Techtools_shrink_siqptv.png\"\n/\u003e\n\nI do all my brainstorming and sketching in \u003ca href=\"https://procreate.art/\"\u003eProcreate\u003c/a\u003e on an iPad Pro 12.5\"\nOnce I'm ready to make the final, I use a combination of Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop. My main machine is a Macbook Pro 2015. It's hooked up to a \u003ca href=\"https://www.wacom.com/en-us/products/pen-displays/cintiq-22-hd\"\u003eWacom Cintiq 22HD\u003c/a\u003e monitor that allows me to hand-paint in details.\n\nThese tools are certainly an integral part of making shit look cool (and I am **_very_** into making shit look cool). There's inherent power in crafting precise shapes in Illustrator. Painting subtle lighting effects with blending layers in Photoshop is a joy. I don't want to disregard the technical side.\n\nBut for most of this blog post I'm not going to focus on it. I'm not convinced telling you what pixel size I set my #EAEFF1 brush to while I careful render diffuse light across a reflective metallic surface like a pedantic perfectionist is helpful. \u003cFootnote idName={3}\u003eIf you would like to learn how to do the shiny lighting stuff, take Sam Neilson's \u003ca href=\"https://www.schoolism.com/school.php?id=3\"\u003eFundamentals of Lighting\u003c/a\u003e on Schoolism. It will drown you in the minutiae of rendering light on surfaces.\u003cbr /\u003eAlso check out the \u003ca href=\"/resources\"\u003eResources\u003c/a\u003e page.\u003c/Footnote\u003e\n\nI will cover that workflow more in Part 4 of this series. But they're not _The Thing We're Doing_. Which is learning how to draw invisible things. So let's get back to talking about the meaty stuff.\n\n---\n\n## Part One - Making Metaphors\n\nLet's start at the bottom of the cake with _Metaphors_.  \n Metaphors are fundamental to how we visualise anything that's a non-physical, abstract **idea**.\n\nDrawing an orange is fairly straight forward. Drawing freedom, financial crashes, racial tension, teamwork, speculation, database management, capitalism, or productivity all relies on metaphor.\n\n### So, what's a Metaphor?\n\nThe first step to getting good at metaphor is understanding what it is.  \nLet's make sure we're all on the same page:\n\n\u003e A metaphor is when we understand one thing in terms of another.\n\nThe power of metaphor is it helps us use something we _know_ to understand something we _don't know_.\n\n\u003cBasicImage\n  width=\"940px\"\n  alt=\"Diagram of thing A projecting onto thing B\"\n  src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dxj9qr5gj/image/upload/v1632316507/maggieappleton.com/essays/drawing-invisibles/mapping_shrink_hylcer.png\"\n/\u003e\n\nWe may not 100% understand Thing B. But we know enough about Thing A, and can **map** its qualities onto Thing B. Which at least gives us a starting point.\n\nI can tell you \u003ca href=\"https://www.wired.com/video/watch/5-levels-4\"\u003ea quantum computing bit is like a spinning coin\u003c/a\u003e that is neither nor heads or tails, but kind of both. And now you're 1% closer to understanding how a quantum computer works.\n\nSometimes we actually know a lot about Thing B, but thinking about it in terms of Thing A gives us insights we never realised before.\n\nIn metaphor nerd terms we call Thing A the **source** and Thing B the **target**. The source is like a _frame_ that we look at the target object through.\n\nIt \"frames\" how we see Thing B.\n\n\u003cBasicImage\n  width=\"880px\"\n  alt=\"Diagram of the source frame and the target object\"\n  src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dxj9qr5gj/image/upload/v1632316505/maggieappleton.com/essays/drawing-invisibles/frame_shrink_irt2qv.png\"\n/\u003e\n\nJust like a window frame, the **source** frame gives us a limited view of the world. Anything outside the frame get _hidden_, while anything within the frame gets _highlighted_.\n\n\u003cBasicImage\n  width=\"940px\"\n  src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dxj9qr5gj/image/upload/v1632316505/maggieappleton.com/essays/drawing-invisibles/hide-highlight_shrink_ljkonq.png\"\n  alt=\"Diagram of highlighting and hiding\"\n/\u003e\n\nQualities that both the source and target share are _highlighted_. While qualities they don't share are _hidden_ away outside the frame.\n\nLet's look at an example of this in action.  \nWe often talk about **time** through the metaphorical frame of **money**.\n\n\u003e That delayed flight _cost_ me an hour.  \n\u003e Can I _steal_ a few minutes of your time?  \n\u003e I don't know if _spending_ all day on that is _worth_ my while.\n\nThe way we speak about time shows we project the qualities of money onto our idea of time.\n\n\u003cBasicImage\n  width=\"940px\"\n  src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dxj9qr5gj/image/upload/v1632316506/maggieappleton.com/essays/drawing-invisibles/timeismoney_shrink_n2s9h4.png\"\n  alt=\"Time is money image\"\n/\u003e\n\nOur _Time is Money_ metaphor highlights the qualities of time that overlap with money:\n\n- Time is a quantifiable substance we can count\n- Time is a valuable, limited resource\n- Time is a something we can give to, and take from other people\n\nThere are plenty of time's qualities hidden by the frame of money. Unlike money, we all experience time as a relative, amorphous flow. It shifts form and length based on where we are, who we're with, what we're doing. One minute in a freezing cold shower does not feel the same one minute in the midst of a deep Netflix binge. One minute is not one minute in the same way one pound is one pound. \u003cFootnote idName={4}\u003eOur metaphors are also deeply cultural, rather than being \"natural\" or \"inherent.\" They emerge in particular historical times and places, and serve particular purposes and particular people. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e There are plenty of cultures where time isn't thought of in this kind of rigid, segmented, and quantifable way. It's firmly rooted in the historical context of a Western, post-Enlightenment, Capitalist society.\u003c/Footnote\u003e\n\nMoney isn't the only metaphor for time. We also compare it to a moving object when we say _\"that hour flew by,\"_ or a container when we say _\"tomorrow is pretty full.\"_\nWe're perfectly capable of using multiple, overlapping metaphors for a single concept. And we're able to switch between them without confusing ourselves. Very handy.\n\n\u003e Which metaphor we pick depends on what qualities we want to highlight or hide. We focus us on what's _important_ about the target, and downplay irrelevant details.\n\nThis is why metaphors are so good at explaining complex ideas. We get fine-grained control over what's most important about the concept, and cut out all the noise.\n\nBeyond just being useful for learning complex concepts, and framing old ideas in new ways, metaphor is the basis of nearly every thought we have. It's a fundamental building block of human cognition that shapes the way we percieve and interact with the world. \u003cFootnote idName={5}\u003eThis goes a bit too deep to elaborate on here, but \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_metaphor\"\u003eCognitive Metaphor Theory\u003c/a\u003e is beautifully mind-blowing and worth exploring when you have time. A good starting point is the book \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphors_We_Live_By\"\u003eMetaphors We Live By\u003c/a\u003e written by \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Lakoff\"\u003eGeorge Lakoff\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Johnson_(philosopher)\"\u003eMark Johnson\u003c/a\u003e. TLDR, they're more important than you think.\u003c/Footnote\u003e\n\n---\n\n### Programming the Metaphors\n\nMetaphorical thinking is _especially_ useful when we're trying to explain and illustrate programming concepts.\n\nThe kind of topics we teach at egghead are _always_:  \na) fundamentally abstract  \nb) haven't been around long enough for our culture to develop a set of meaningful icons and visual symbols for them\n\nTry, for a moment to imagine what \"\u003ca href=\"https://egghead.io/courses/use-typescript-to-develop-react-applications\"\u003eTypescript with React\u003c/a\u003e\" visually looks like. Or \"\u003ca href=\"https://egghead.io/courses/build-a-server-rendered-reactjs-application-with-next-js\"\u003eA Server-rendered ReactJS Application with Next.js\u003c/a\u003e\". Or the \"\u003ca href=\"https://egghead.io/courses/state-monad-in-javascript\"\u003eState Monad in JavaScript\u003c/a\u003e\"\n\nNot exactly a vivid picture in your mind, right?\n\nThis is partly because programming is an abstract activity. It has to be.  \nTaken literally, programming involves running enormously complex sequences of electrical currents. On a microscopic scale. Inside our machines.  \nThat world isn't human friendly. We can't see what's going on or control what happens without a thick layer of symbolic software in the middle.\n\nSo we invented programming languages.  \nThe JavaScript snippet `let fruit = banana` _maps onto_ a specific set of electrical pulses firing deep inside your hardware.\n\nIn programmer land this is called an _abstraction_.\n\nFunnily enough, it also fits our definition of a metaphor. _Programming is just a giant stack of metaphors._ Each layer of the metaphorical stack moves us further away from machine world, and closer to human world. \u003cFootnote idName={6}\u003eHere's a terribly nerdy MIT PhD thesis about it if you want to go down the rabbit hole... \u003ca href=\"http://alumni.media.mit.edu/~mt/thesis/mt-thesis.html\"\u003eProgramming with Agents:\u003c/a\u003e\u003ci\u003e New metaphors for thinking about computation\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/Footnote\u003e\n\nIllustrated metaphors that capture the main idea of a programming concept are just one more addition to the top of our human-friendly stack.\n\n\u003cimg\n  alt=\"Illustration of a stack that starts with a motherboard chip, then shows machine binary code, then bytecode, then a javascript snippet of a while loop, and at the top an illustration of a ferris wheel\"\n  src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dxj9qr5gj/image/upload/v1632316506/maggieappleton.com/essays/drawing-invisibles/abstractiontower_shrink_te1b4k.png\"\n/\u003e\n\n---\n\n### Learning to Metaphorically See\n\nNow that you're thoroughly soaked in trippy metaphor theory, let's bring it back down to earth with some familiar examples.\n\nOne way to hone your metaphor-making skills is to explicitly notice when you're seeing one. We process metaphors automatically and unconsciously. Which means it takes a little effort to consciously understand how they work.\n\nLet's take another look at some of these course illustrations, and work backwards to break down each piece of the metaphor.\n\nI'm going to use the \u003cspan role=\"img\" aria-label=\"target\"\u003e 🎯 \u003c/span\u003e emoji to label targets, and \u003cspan role=\"img\" aria-label=\"source\"\u003e\n⛲️ \u003c/span\u003e to label sources.\n\n\u003cTwoColumn maxWidth=\"1000px\" justifyItems=\"start\"\u003e\n\n\u003cBasicImage\n  width=\"420px\"\n  alt=\"\"\n  src=\"https://d2eip9sf3oo6c2.cloudfront.net/series/square_covers/000/000/235/full/EGH_CSSSelectors_Final.png\"\n/\u003e\n\n\u003cspan style={{ maxWidth: \"550px\", paddingLeft: \"1em\" }}\u003e\n  \u003cbr /\u003e\n  \u003ch4 style={{ marginTop: 0 }}\u003eAdvanced CSS Selectors\u003c/h4\u003e\n  \u003cp\u003e\n    The webpage{\" \"}\n    \u003cspan role=\"img\" aria-label=\"target\"\u003e\n      🎯\n    \u003c/span\u003e{\" \"}\n    is a customisable house{\" \"}\n    \u003cspan role=\"img\" aria-label=\"source\"\u003e\n      ⛲️\n    \u003c/span\u003e\n    .

They act as one-way pointers we follow in a linear sequence.\n\nWhile we can link to any site, the destination page hasn't a clue we've done so.\n\nWe set up all these single direction paths, trying to signal relevance and context, only to have the other side completely ignore our efforts.\n\nOur monolinks are trying to establish relationships in vain.\n\n\u003cBasicImage\n  width=\"950px\"\n  src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dg3gyk0gu/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto,q_auto:good,w_1200/v1589455927/maggieappleton.com/notes/Hyperlinks.png\"\n/\u003e\n\nWe're starting to look around our mono-linked environment, and wonder why it's so hard to surface relevant, contextual relationships.\n\nManually interlinking content takes an awful lot of human curation and effort.

He wanted a system capable of \"associative indexing... whereby any item may be caused at will to select immediately and automatically another... [so that] numerous items have been thus joined together to form a trail.\"\n\nThis essay turned out to be a foundational document for the ideologies that directly led to both the internet and the Web. \u003cFootnote idName={1}\u003eYes, those are two entirely seperate pieces of technology.\u003c/Footnote\u003e Vannevar was one of the key movers and shakers rallying folks to help build the original internet infrastructure. He coralled folks at MIT, the US Department of Defence, the National Science Foundation and various research labs like the Standford Lincoln Lab, Bell Labs, the RAND corporation, and Xerox PARC to get involved. \u003cFootnote idName={2}\u003eWalter Isaacson, \u003ca href=\"https://www.librarything.com/work/15179823\"\u003eThe Innovators\u003c/a\u003e: How a Group of Hackers, Geniuses, and Geeks Created the Digital Revolution (London: Simon \u0026 Schuster, 2015).\u003c/Footnote\u003e\n\nSuffice to say, the guy was driven by a belief that enabling people to connect information and share knowledge would expand the scope of human understanding. The Memex was one idea of how that might manifest in material form.\n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n\u003cBasicImage\n  showalt\n  alt=\"Vannevar even created a small informative diagram of this desk-bound vision.

Most were still the domain of large military operations like Bletchley Park, and seen as inconveniently large calculators.\n\nImplementing a wildly interactive computational personal knowledge base wasn't much of an option.\n\nSo the idea went into hiberation, and didn't resurface until the idea of personal computing began blooming in the sixties and seventies. \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Nelson\"\u003eTed Nelson\u003c/a\u003e, an unlikely film director and sociologist, stumbled into a series of computing lectures and began to imagine how graphical interfaces might reinvent the way we write and connect ideas. He took inspiration directly from Vannevar's essay, and in 1965 when he coined the term _hypertext_ to describe his vision for a sprawling network of interlinking information.\n\nNelson planned to implement these hypertextual dreams in his perpetually-imminent Project Xanadu. \u003cFootnote idName={3}\u003eIf you have some time, this is quite the internet history \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Xanadu\"\u003erabbit hole\u003c/a\u003e to run down. \u003cbr /\u003e Ted Nelson is on \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0NgV3yNd2o\"\u003eanother level\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/Footnote\u003e\n\nThe Xanadu project was a hypertext system that imagined that every sentence, block, and page would be part of a vast bi-directionally linked network.\n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n\u003cImageFrame\n  showalt\n  alt=\"A design mockup of how Project Xanadu might visually connect pieces of text across multiple documents\"\n  width=\"1050px\"\n  src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dg3gyk0gu/image/upload/c_scale,w_1000/v1589545780/maggieappleton.com/notes/xanadu.png\"\n/\u003e\n\n\u003cCenter\u003e\n\n\u003cimg\n  width=\"100px\"\n  alt=\"fleshed emoji face\"\n  src=\"https://emojipedia-us.s3.dualstack.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/thumbs/120/apple/237/flushed-face_1f633.png\"\n/\u003e\n\n\u003c/Center\u003e\n\nYou'd be able to trace information back to its origin the way current web links do. But you'd also be able to see who had referenced, remixed, and expanded off that original. The full [[Pattern Language of Project Xanadu]] expands far beyond just bi-directional links to include features like [[Transclusions]], but we won't dive into it all here.\n\nSuffice to say, Xanadu didn't pan out.\n\nInstead we got the less fancy, but far more real and useable World Wide Web that currently does not support bi-directionals on an infrastructre level.\n\nWhile Sir Tim Berner's Lee \u003ca href=\"https://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/Topology.html\"\u003ewrote himself a note\u003c/a\u003e debating their pros and cons back in 1999, there is an obvious design issue with letting two-way connections flow freely around the web.\n\nIf _every_ site that linked to yours was visible on your page, and you had no control over who could and couldn't link to you, it is not hard to imagine the Trollish implications...\n\nFiguring out how we might filter, moderate, and set permissions around link visibility turned into \u003ca href=\"https://dl.acm.org/doi/epdf/10.1145/74224.74236\"\u003equite the challenge\u003c/a\u003e.

Lots of people are still mad about it. Let's not venture too far down that historical wormhole.\n\n\u003e **The TLDR is technology is hard**.\n\nUntil \u003ca href=\"https://www.wired.com/1995/06/xanadu/\"\u003eXanadu ships\u003c/a\u003e and we're all immersed in the universe of multi-linked, version-controlled nodes of remixable micro-content (that somehow solves the problems of permissions and moderation), there are still plenty of ways we can resurrect the possibility of bi-directional links on the web.\n\n---\n\n## Bi-direction Linking in Personal Digital Gardens\n\nMost of the design issues with adding bi-directional links to the global web were related to moderation and permissions. However, adding them within the bounds of a single website with one author sidesteps that problem.\n\nThere's been a flurry of interest around bi-directionals among people involved in the [[Digital Gardening]] movement.\n\nMuch of this was originally sparked by \u003ca href=\"https://notes.andymatuschak.org/\"\u003eAndy Matuschak's notes\u003c/a\u003e. Go have a good browse through them.\n\n\u003cImageFrame\n  showalt\n  alt=\"Andy's linked notes stack on top of one another, allowing you to browse to new notes while previous notes are still visible\"\n  width=\"1050px\"\n  src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dg3gyk0gu/image/upload/c_scale,w_960/v1589545795/maggieappleton.com/notes/andy-note-links.png\"\n/\u003e\n\n\u003cSpacer size=\"small\" /\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\n  There's plenty to admire here.\n  \u003cFootnote idName={4}\u003e\n    It should be noted Andy is an experienced developer and interaction\n    designer, and these notes should not be taken as the standard expectation\n    for the rest of us normal plebby internet citizens.\n  \u003c/Footnote\u003e But the key part of this system that creates interlinked context is\n  the \u003cb\u003e\"Links to this Note\"\u003c/b\u003e section at the bottom of each post.{\" \"}\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\nAnytime Andy links to another one of their notes on the site, it'll pop up as a related note at the bottom of the page.

Thankfully, setting up your own public gardening bi-directional Memex doesn't involve Xanadu.\n\nOne fantastic option for non-developers is based around a personal wiki system called \u003ca href=\"https://tiddlywiki.com/\"\u003eTiddlyWiki\u003c/a\u003e. Anne-Laure Le Cunff wrote up an easy-to-follow guide to getting \u003ca href=\"https://nesslabs.com/tiddlywiki-beginner-tutorial\"\u003e your own up and running\u003c/a\u003e.\n\nFor those of us here for the hyper-customised, over-engineered JavaScript solution (that would be me 🙌), the \u003ca href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.org/\"\u003eGatsby.js\u003c/a\u003e community has a number of active gardening enthusiasts building themes and plugins.\n\nI built mine using Aengus McMillin's \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/aengusmcmillin/gatsby-theme-brain\"\u003egatsby-theme-brain\u003c/a\u003e. Aengus has documented the theme well and it's not too challenging to implement (as long as you're comfortable in JavaScript and React).\n\nI also curate a list of tools for [[Digital Gardening]] on this [Github repo](https://github.com/MaggieAppleton/digital-gardeners/)\n\n---\n\n### Bi-Directional Linking with WebMentions\n\nWhile I argued that Web-wide bi-directional links are unlikely to happen at a global scale, there's a way you can add bi-directionals to your personal website that picks up on references anywhere on the web.\n\n[WebMentions](https://webmention.io/) are an piece of web infrastructre the [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org/) community has done a lot of work to advocate for. The W3C gave the [specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/webmention/) _recommendation_ status in 2017.\n\nThe system notifies a URL whenever that site is mentioned elsewhere on the web. You're then able to show that mention and its contents on your site. It's essentially an opt-in bi-directional linking system.\n\nPlenty of folks have written useful guides on how to add these to your site. Here's one for any [static site](https://keithjgrant.com/posts/2019/02/adding-webmention-support-to-a-static-site/), one for [Gatsby](https://www.christopherbiscardi.com/post/building-gatsby-plugin-webmentions), one for [Next.js](https://css-tricks.com/jumping-into-webmentions-with-nextjs-or-not/). In fact there's a whole list of implementation examples on the [IndieWeb Wiki](https://indieweb.org/Webmention#IndieWeb_Examples) you can look through.\n","data":{"title":"A Short History of Bi-Directional Links","description":"Seventy years ago we dreamed up links that would allow us to create two-way, contextual conversations.

Specifically, how to create systems on the open web where people can publish their personal book collections, share and find other people's book lists, and generally use books as a medium to connect with each other.\n\n\u003c/IntroParagraph\u003e\n\nYou can do most of these things via existing platforms; Goodreads being the canonical example. You can track your reading, write reviews, join reading groups, and browse curated book lists. But like all private, walled gardens, it comes with a few predictable catches:\n\n- Your library data belongs to Goodreads and you'll have trouble ever getting it out again. \u003cFootnote idName={1}\u003eGoodreads used to provide an API for developers, but as of [December 2020](https://www.goodreads.com/api/documentation) they no longer issue new keys. There's probably good reason for this, but it speaks to fundamental issues of access and power in closed ecosystems\u003c/Footnote\u003e If Goodreads goes down, it'll take all your books, groups, and connections with it.\n- You have no power or agency as a user to adapt or extend the Goodreads system to fit your own needs. You have to accept and use whatever features and affordances the product managers, designers, and developers of Goodreads deem important.\n\nThis doesn't make Goodreads evil. It makes it unappealing for people who care about long-term resiliency, open data on the web, and end-users having agency over their tools.\n\nThe pop-up session focused on exploring alternatives to closed platforms; what pieces of infrastructure might enable us to build a 'decentralized Goodreads'? Plenty of us publish personal libraries to our own websites, but rarely in common formats that can talk to one another or pool data into communal centres to find connections and relationships.\n\n\u003cDisclaimer title=\"Session Notes\"\u003e\n\nYou can read the [collaborative notes](https://indieweb.org/2022/Pop-ups/Personal_Libraries#Notes) we all took during the session on the IndieWeb wiki.\n\n\u003c/Disclaimer\u003e\n\n## Data Exchange Formats\n\nMost of the pop-up focused on the issue of data exchange formats. How do we get independent websites to agree on a common format for books? This includes both the format the data is passed between sites in (RSS, JSON, OPML, CSV), and the shape of the data itself.\n\nMy [Library](/library) and [Antilibrary](/antilibrary) book collections on this site are perfect examples of poorly formatted data that can't be automatically read by other sites. They're currently generated by an object in [a JavaScript file](https://github.com/MaggieAppleton/maggieappleton.com-V2/blob/main/posts/data/books.js):\n\n```js\nexport const bookData = [\n  {\n    title: \"Computers as Theatre\",\n    author: \"Brenda Laurel\",\n    cover: \"/images/books/theatre.jpg\",\n    link: \"https://www.google.co.uk/books/edition/Computers_as_Theatre/NedQAAAAMAAJ\",\n  },\n  {\n    title: \"Everything, All the Time, Everywhere\",\n    subtitle: \"How We Became Postmodern\",\n    author: \"Stuart Jeffries\",\n    cover: \"/images/books/everything.jpg\",\n    link: \"https://www.google.co.uk/books/edition/Everything_All_the_Time_Everywhere/pchGEAAAQBAJ\",\n  },\n  {\n    title: \"The Design of Everyday Things\",\n    author: \"Don Norman\",\n    cover: \"/images/books/designthings.jpg\",\n    link: \"https://www.google.co.uk/books/edition/The_Design_of_Everyday_Things/heCtnQEACAAJ\",\n  },\n];\n```\n\nI have a title, author, a cover image in a local image folder, and a link to the book record on Google Books. This might be all I need to display a bunch of books on my library page, but it's poorly designed from an interoperability standpoint.\n\nI'd never considered the limitations of this approach before the event, only because I hadn't thought ahead to the possiblity of publishing this list in ways others could consume it. \u003cFootnote idName={2}\u003eI also built this website under the mantra of \"do the bare minimum and no more\" so it's a garden of low-hanging fruit\u003c/Footnote\u003e\n\nHow could we improve the formatting of this data to standardise it? First, we'd have to make sure each book entry had a set of properties that would help identify it in a larger context. Title and author are useful, but they're not enough. We'd also need a UID (unique identification) number like an ISBN to make sure we don't misidentify books – duplicate titles and author names are uncommon but not unheard of.\n\nPeople in the pop-up session suggested adding a number of optional, nice-to-have properties like reading status (to read, reading, read), page count, related notes, reading start and end dates, rating (out of 5), and genre/tags.\n\nThese would be harder to standardise than the core properties and factual metadata, but hold much more potential for enabling rich social interactions around books.\n\nA few people reasonably pointed out we'll never have a single, unified format. It's better to pursue forgiving and flexible standards that enable people to publish books in a variety of formats. And instead build tools that can translate between formats and map properties from one type to another.\n\n### Prior Art and Existing Systems\n\nThis problem space isn't new and plenty of people have built bits and pieces of potential solutions.\n\nThere are a number of existing standard formats for books:\n\n- Schema.org has a [Book type](https://schema.org/Book) with an extensive list of properties\n- Google has a [standard format](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/structured-data/book) for surfacing books in search results\n\n[Tom Critchlow](https://tomcritchlow.com/) wrote a piece proposing [Library JSON](https://tomcritchlow.com/2020/04/15/library-json/) - a standard format for book data exchange. [Tom Zijlstra](https://www.zylstra.org/) adapted it to [OPML format](https://www.zylstra.org/blog/booklist-opml-data-structure/) \u003cFootnote idName={2}\u003eOMPL = Outline processor markup language. A format used to import and export from RSS feeds.\u003c/Footnote\u003eusing the properties defined on the Schema.org book type.\n\nPublishing feeds in either JSON or RSS would allow us to create streams of books and subscribe to them using existing systems. Working with RSS feeds and writing JSON isn't the most user friendly interface though. Most people outside the world of web development would need something closer to a traditional GUI to manage their collections. Some people suggested spreadsheets as an accessible interface format.\n\nAnother possibility is encouraging people to shift from platforms like Goodreads over to more open platforms with API access. The Internet Archive has setup [Open Library](https://openlibrary.org) which is a non-profit, open-source book catalogue. They provide both a user-friendly interface for creating book lists, and have [an API](https://openlibrary.org/developers/api) that allows you to fetch book information like covers, authors, and lists (currently reading, best sci-fi novels, etc.).\n\nFrankly, these data exchange issues are outside my wheelhouse. I'm glad other people get a kick out of standardising schemas. I'm just here for the UX design challenges and social implications once we've sorted out how to surface this data.\n\n## Ad Hoc Reading Groups\n\nAn idea I brought to the event and ended up hosting a session on was _ad hoc reading groups_ – discussions and meetups facilitated by our public bookshelves.\n\nPersonal bookshelves on website are a jazzy feature, but it's sometimes unclear what they're _for_. What does publishing a personal library to the web _do_ for us?\n\nThey certainly help lay contextual groundwork for people visiting our personal websites. They tell others what kind of ideas we've encountered and what disciplines we've studied.\n\nThey also work well as invitations. Books are an easy starting point for conversation; \"oh you read that too!\". People frequently reference a book from my shelf when they first send a Twitter DM or email.\n\nThey could do more though. Publishing a book to a public library could be a way to signal you want to _talk_ to other people about it. We all have at least a few obscure or niche titles on our shelves, and it can be hard to find other people willing to read and discuss them. Why not simply start with the people who are already interested in that book?\n\nBookclubs and reading clubs are obviously well established social formats we can borrow from to imagine how this could work. Usually you gather a group of people, then muddle through some democratic system of voting on books, and eventually everyone compromises on what to read. This is slightly easier with fiction, but non-fiction gets particularly tricky, unless you gather a group based on a specific discipline or domain.\n\nTaking a book-first, rather than a group-first approach would enable reading groups who don't have to compromise on their book choices. They could gather only once or twice to discuss the book, then go their seperate ways. No long-term committment to organising and maintaining a bookclub required. \u003cFootnote idName={4}\u003eFor the record, I'm not against the group-first bookclub approach. I was raised in a home that hosted multiple bookclubs a week, and I've been part of plenty of good ones as an adult. I just think there's room for other alternative formats for reading groups.\u003c/Footnote\u003e\n\nWe would need a system that enables people to:\n\n- Publish a list of books they would be willing to discuss with other people to the open web. [Antilibraries](https://www.antilibrari.es/) – collections of books you haven't read yet but would like to read – are particularly well suited to this proposition.\n- See which books people in their social network want to discuss, and/or subscribe to other people's lists\n- Be notified when 4+ people in their network have the same book on their discussion list – possibly via an email thread? \u003cFootnote idName={5}\u003eThe ideal number of participants in a discussion group is obviously a matter of subjective preference. I've always found 4-7 an ideal number. Enough to lose one. Not too many to jostle for talking time.\u003c/Footnote\u003e\n- Coordinate and schedule a time to read and discuss the book with that group.\n\nThere are plenty of troublesome assumptions and unanswered pragmatic issues in that sketch. What's a \"social network\" (are using the Twitter API to check for mutuals)? What kind of system is scanning for book matches between lists? Is it capable of firing off group email chains once it finds one? How would it handle keeping email addresses private and double-checking people want to opt-in to a particular discussion group? Could people see upcoming groups and choose to join one opportunistically?\n\nThe more I think through these questions, the more it feels necessary to have some third-party intemediary service in the middle to match up book lists and email out proposed discussion groups to people. Not a \"platform,\" but a mediator of independent websites. Ideally one with minimal maitenance costs and moderation work, lest someone try to turn it into a 'startup'.\n\nI have to think about it more. My friends over at [Hyperlink Academy](https://hyperlink.academy/) are experimenting with models and infrastructure to quickly spin up clubs and peer-to-peer learning groups – some of which could be part of the solution.\n\nIf you have ideas about how we might duct-tape together internet protocols or existing services to make something like this possible, I'd love to read them. Preferably as a public essay instead of a DM, but I appreciate that's not everyone's MO.\n","data":{"title":"Interoperable Personal Libraries and Ad Hoc Reading Groups","description":"Exploring ways to build social infrastructure around books and reading on the open web","startDate":"2022-02-20","updated":"2022-02-26","type":"note","topics":["The Web","Collaborative Learning","Data","Design"],"growthStage":"budding"},"slug":"interoperable-libraries","filePath":"interoperable-libraries.mdx"},{"content":"\n\u003cIntroParagraph\u003e\n    \nAn eponymous law is a principle or rule named after a particular person.

Specifically, making pictures of programmes. Ideally pictures worth a thousand programmes, as the traditional saying goes.\n\nI’ve spent my whole career so far creating visual representations of programmes.\n\nDuring my time at [egghead](https://egghead.io/) I made hundreds of cover illustrations for the courses we taught.\n\n\u003cBasicImage\n  width=\"900\"\n  src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dxj9qr5gj/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto,q_auto:good,w_1100/v1638480669/maggieappleton.com/notes/programming-pictures/PicturesProgramming-03_aqfzx7.jpg\"\n  alt=\"A selection of egghead course illustrations\"\n/\u003e\n\nEach of these would start with an abstract programming concept that I had to find a way to visually represent in a single image\n\nI learned to rely heavily on visual metaphors for these. Styling with CSS became painting a house.\nAnd became organising types in typescript became sorting suits in a deck of cards.\n\nI've also made a lot of illustrated diagrams over the years to explain topics like how [[JavaScript prototype inheritance]] works, or what happens when you flatten an array, or how [[APIs]] are like small robotic waiters.\n\n\u003cBasicImage\n  width=\"900\"\n  src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dxj9qr5gj/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto,q_auto:good,w_1100/v1638480669/maggieappleton.com/notes/programming-pictures/PicturesProgramming-05_yfxfdt.jpg\"\n  alt=\"Illustrated notes on APIs\"\n/\u003e\n\n\u003cBasicImage\n  width=\"900\"\n  src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dxj9qr5gj/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto,q_auto:good,w_1100/v1638480669/maggieappleton.com/notes/programming-pictures/PicturesProgramming-04_vfhpey.jpg\"\n  alt=\"Illustrated notes on JavaScript prototypes\"\n/\u003e\n\nThe goal of all these illustrations is to make complex technical topics relatable and easier to understand, a theme you’ll hear a lot about in this talk.\n\nI also recently collaborated on a project called [Just JavaScript](https://justjavascript.com) with [Dan Abramov](https://overreacted.io)\n\n\u003cBasicImage\n  width=\"900\"\n  src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dxj9qr5gj/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto,q_auto:good,w_1100/v1638480669/maggieappleton.com/notes/programming-pictures/PicturesProgramming-06_mxpzls.jpg\"\n  alt=\"A cover image of the Just JavaScript logo and graphic\"\n/\u003e\n\nIt’s a JavaScript course that teaches the core mental models of the language through visual diagrams and animations.\n\nWe worked together to develop a visual language that was a bit more formal than the previous illustrations I showed.\n\n\u003cBasicImage\n  width=\"900\"\n  src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dxj9qr5gj/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto,q_auto:good,w_1100/v1638480804/maggieappleton.com/notes/programming-pictures/PicturesProgramming-07_r6syon.jpg\"\n  alt=\"Diagrams from the Just JavaScript course showing the relationship between variables and objects\"\n/\u003e\n\nEvery piece of syntax correlated to a specific visual shape, and we used the system to explain concepts like assigning properties and object mutation.\n\nNow, I’m not running through all this work to show off – I just wanted to give you some context around the kind of programming visuals I’ve made in the past so you have a sense what I mean when I refer to _‘pictures of programming’._\n\nIn going through this process of transforming programming concepts into visual images hundreds of times, I’ve been forced to think a lot about the way we represent and communicate complex programming ideas.\n\nAnd I’ve come to believe visual representations have a lot to offer us over here in the land of code.\n\nIn this talk I’m going to show you how visuals can make programming concepts:\n\n- less abstract\n- easier to understand\n- more accessible to more people\n\n\u003cBasicImage\n  width=\"900\"\n  src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dxj9qr5gj/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto,q_auto:good,w_1100/v1638480813/maggieappleton.com/notes/programming-pictures/PicturesProgramming-08_oep11w.jpg\"\n  alt=\"Visual make programming concepts less abstract, easier to understand, and more accessible to more people\"\n/\u003e\n\nI’m also going to show you why visuals are so special. And it turns out to be relatively simple…\n\n\u003e Visuals bring invisible, abstract programming concepts down into the embodied world.\n\nThe embodied world is where you and I live. Everyone watching this talk has a body. And you use it to interact with physical objects around you, to move through space, and experience events over time. Everything you know about the world is mediated through your body, and this fact is so fundamental we sometimes completely forget it.\n\nAnd programming concepts are abstract ideas that do not live in the embodied world here with us.\n\nThey’re imaginary objects and functions… that exist in a liminal space that feels like it doesn’t obey the same laws of physics that we do.\n\n\u003cBasicImage\n  width=\"900\"\n  src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dxj9qr5gj/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto,q_auto:good,w_1100/v1638480817/maggieappleton.com/notes/programming-pictures/PicturesProgramming-10_escc5w.jpg\"\n  alt=\"A person writing linear code while thinking about programming objects in physical space in their mind\"\n/\u003e\n\nAnd we can only interact with them through this disembodied experience of typing linear text instructions into a code editor.\n\nThis is precisely what make programming so difficult. We’re trying to reason about and work with things we cannot see or touch, when we are creatures who are evolutionarily adapted to function in a highly visual, spatial, physical world.\n\nAnd I think visuals are big part of bridging that gap between our embodied human world and the disembodied machine world we’re all trying to programme in.\n\nSo here’s the plan. We’re going to explore this topic through three questions:\n\n- ‘What’s wrong with text?’\n- ‘What can visuals do that text can’t?’\n- “Haven’t we already tried this?”\n\n\u003cBasicImage\n  width=\"900\"\n  src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dxj9qr5gj/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto,q_auto:good,w_1100/v1638480823/maggieappleton.com/notes/programming-pictures/PicturesProgramming-11_uaidqj.jpg\"\n  alt=\"An overview of what this talk will cover\"\n/\u003e\n\nAfter all, there are no new ideas under the sun. Many, many people in the past have explored ways to make programming more visual. We’re going to look at what’s already been tried, and what opportunities still lie ahead.\n\n## I. What’s wrong with text?\n\nThis is an important question to ask because almost everything we do in programming is expressed in text.\n\nThis is how every app you’ve ever worked on looks. Text arranged in lines going from left to right and top to bottom.\n\n\u003cImageFrame\n  width=\"900\"\n  src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dxj9qr5gj/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto,q_auto:good,w_1100/v1638480832/maggieappleton.com/notes/programming-pictures/PicturesProgramming-13_gh4bey.jpg\"\n  alt=\"A screenshot of a code editor showing lines runnning left to right and top to bottom\"\n/\u003e\n\nHere’s every documentation website you’ve ever read\n\n\u003cImageFrame\n  width=\"900\"\n  src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dxj9qr5gj/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto,q_auto:good,w_1100/v1638480835/maggieappleton.com/notes/programming-pictures/PicturesProgramming-14_jywqro.jpg\"\n  alt=\"A screenshot of a documentation website\"\n/\u003e\n\nAnd here’s every blog post you’ve ever learned from.\n\n\u003cImageFrame\n  width=\"900\"\n  src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dxj9qr5gj/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto,q_auto:good,w_1100/v1638480838/maggieappleton.com/notes/programming-pictures/PicturesProgramming-15_fel35e.jpg\"\n  alt=\"A screenshot of a blog post\"\n/\u003e\n\nAll of our current programming languages, tools, interfaces, and documentation are overwhelmingly text-centric.\n\nYou sometimes get a diagram here and there, but it’s really slim pickings.\n\nIf I had to guess the balance of text to visuals in our industry, I’d bet we’re at 98% text to 2% visuals.\n\n\u003cBasicImage\n  width=\"900\"\n  src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dxj9qr5gj/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto,q_auto:good,w_1100/v1638480997/maggieappleton.com/notes/programming-pictures/PicturesProgramming-16_n92kyq.jpg\"\n  alt=\"A graphic showing 98% text to 2% visuals\"\n/\u003e\n\nI haven’t done any official surveys on this and I couldn’t find anyone else who has, so this is just based off my personal experience in the web development community.\n\nIf you take a minute and think over all the code and documentation you encounter on a daily basis, I’m betting you land on a similar estimate.\n\nIf we look at the history of programming, it’s fairly clear how we ended up in such a text-heavy world.\n\nThis is a computer circa 1970. You’ll notice the lack of screen.\n\n\u003cBasicImage\n  width=\"900\"\n  src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dxj9qr5gj/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto,q_auto:good,w_1100/v1638480997/maggieappleton.com/notes/programming-pictures/PicturesProgramming-17_fgfbnq.jpg\"\n  alt=\"\"\n/\u003e\n\nYou had a keyboard and a stack of punchcards, and the only thing you could do was type linear text to create programmes.\n\nThis design constraint meant all our early programming languages were text-based. And once you establish text as the primary paradigm of a field, it becomes hard to break away from. Especially in an industry where we rely so heavily on lower level abstractions created by all the programmers who came before us.\n\nThere are also plenty of logical reasons why we rely so heavily on text in programming. Written words and syntax are ideal mediums for expressing abstract logic.\n\n\u003cBasicImage\n  width=\"900\"\n  src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dxj9qr5gj/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto,q_auto:good,w_1100/v1638481005/maggieappleton.com/notes/programming-pictures/PicturesProgramming-18_clk6lm.jpg\"\n  alt=\"\"\n/\u003e\n\n- It’s quick to create\n- It’s flexible and it’s easy to move between applications using copy and paste without worrying about compatibility.\n- You can pack a dense amount of information into a very small space\n- You can be very specific about what you mean, which obviously matters when we’re talking to computers who have no sense of nuance.\n\nSo far text has been working great for us in programming.\n\nBut some of text’s greatest strengths are also its greatest weaknesses.\n\nThe abstract nature of text is what removes it from our embodied experiences in space and time.\n\n\u003cBasicImage\n  width=\"900\"\n  src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dxj9qr5gj/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto,q_auto:good,w_1100/v1639240195/maggieappleton.com/notes/programming-pictures/PicturesProgramming-19_tcqwnh.jpg\"\n  alt=\"\"\n/\u003e\n\nWhen we write code, we’re writing a set of hypothetical instructions to run on someone else’s machine at some point in the future, in a time and place we’ll never know about.\n\nThis level of abstraction removes the physical, spatial, and embodied qualities that humans rely upon to understand the world around us.\n\nThis can be good in some ways. When we write a function like `fetchUserData()` we don’t have to define the size, shape, or colour of it. It’s just a simple function floating in machine land.\n\n\u003cBasicImage\n  width=\"900\"\n  src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dxj9qr5gj/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto,q_auto:good,w_1100/v1638481015/maggieappleton.com/notes/programming-pictures/PicturesProgramming-20_emrym4.jpg\"\n  alt=\"\"\n/\u003e\n\nIf you already know what’s this function is and how it works and where its located, this level of brevity is great.\n\nBut imagine someone new to programming who has never written a function to fetch user data, and has no pre-existing mental model of how it might work.\n\nOne of the easiest and most effective ways to make it comprehensible to them is to explain it in familiar terms…\n\nby using physical qualities they already understand like size, shape, colour, and spatial relationships.\n\nWhich might give us something like this to help explain what a fetchUserData function does.\n\n\u003cBasicImage\n  width=\"900\"\n  src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dxj9qr5gj/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto,q_auto:good,w_1100/v1638481015/maggieappleton.com/notes/programming-pictures/PicturesProgramming-21_wyc9pa.jpg\"\n  alt=\"A diagram of fetch user data function cycling from a cloud back to the application\"\n/\u003e\n\nThe visual doesn’t have to be crazy complex or beautiful. Boxes and arrows work great. We’re certainly allowed to use text labels to make the imagery clear.\n\nVisuals lets us use our pre-existing embodied knowledge to show how programmes work in a that way text can’t.\n\n## II. What can visuals give us that text can't?\n\nI think visuals reveal three aspects of programming that we’re unable to see in text.\n\n\u003cBasicImage\n  width=\"900\"\n  src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dxj9qr5gj/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto,q_auto:good,w_1100/v1638481021/maggieappleton.com/notes/programming-pictures/PicturesProgramming-23_sgmjtt.jpg\"\n  alt=\"Visuals reveal metaphors, spatial meaning, and change over time in ways that linear tect can't\"\n/\u003e\n\n- They reveal fundamental metaphors embedded in our programming languages.\n- They reveal spatial mappings that we use to reason about how our programmes are structured and how data moves through them.\n- They reveal how our programmes and data behave over time.\n\nThese things all are _implicit_ in the programmes we write, but not things we can _explicitly show_ in the medium of linear text.\n\n### Visual mediums reveal **metaphors**\n\nLet’s start with metaphors\n\nJust to make sure we’re all on the same page, let’s establish that metaphors are thinking tools that allow us to understand one thing in terms of another.\n\n\u003cBasicImage\n  width=\"900\"\n  src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dxj9qr5gj/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto,q_auto:good,w_1100/v1638481027/maggieappleton.com/notes/programming-pictures/PicturesProgramming-25_eej8mz.jpg\"\n  alt=\"Metaphors allow us to understand one thing in terms of another\"\n/\u003e\n\nSo let’s say we have Thing A here that we understand, and Thing B which we don’t.\n\nAnd in order to help us understand Thing B and get a general idea about what it's like and what it can do, we map the qualities of Thing A onto it.\n\nIf we say corruption is a disease, we understand that corruption spreads, is difficult to overcome, and if left unchecked, can kill.\n\nSimilarly, we often say life is a journey. There are many paths our lives might take, they vary in length, and they all have a beginning, and a final destination \u003cspan\u003e💀\u003c/span\u003e.\n\n\u003cBasicImage\n  width=\"900\"\n  src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dxj9qr5gj/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto,q_auto:good,w_1100/v1638481030/maggieappleton.com/notes/programming-pictures/PicturesProgramming-26_vnlzye.jpg\"\n  alt=\"A diagram showing Thing A and an arrow mapping it onto Thing B\"\n/\u003e\n\nNow when I talk about metaphor in the context of programming, I don’t mean the creative, fanciful metaphors you find in poetry and parables like taking the road less travelled or wandering lonely as a cloud.\n\nThose are called figurative or poetic metaphor. They’re the sort we’re warned not to use in technical tutorials since elaborate, poorly chosen metaphors can be more confusing than helpful.\n\nI’m talking about much more fundamental type of metaphor that lies at the heart of all abstract thinking, including programming.\n\nThese are called **cognitive metaphors** since they enable cognition on a much deeper level.\n\n\u003cBasicImage\n  width=\"900\"\n  src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dxj9qr5gj/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto,q_auto:good,w_1100/v1639241159/maggieappleton.com/notes/programming-pictures/PicturesProgramming-28_jmwilk.jpg\"\n  alt=\"Cognitive metaphors are based in our embodied experience of the world\"\n/\u003e\n\nThese cognitive metaphors are based in our embodied experiences of the world.\n\nWe have all these non-physical things we need to communicate to each other like emotions, and thoughts, and ideas, and programming concepts.\n\nAnd in order to understand them and talk about them, we use our experience of the physical world around us as a metaphor.\n\nIf you look at the way we talk about abstract things, this becomes obvious….\n\n- We talk about ideas in terms of light when we say “that's a bright idea” or “that really illuminates the problem”\n- We talk about emotions like they’re objects. We say “he hid his jealousy” or “she don’t handle anger very well”\n- We can also use force and motion metaphors to describe experiences, like I found your talk moving, it really touched me\n- We talk about programming ideas in terms of temperature like hot reloading in React or how the JavaScript landscape is heating up\n\n\u003cBasicImage\n  width=\"900\"\n  src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dxj9qr5gj/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto,q_auto:good,w_1100/v1639241182/maggieappleton.com/notes/programming-pictures/PicturesProgramming-29_mwgs87.jpg\"\n  alt=\"\"\n/\u003e\n\nThis isn’t a theory I’ve just come up with on my own.\n\nThese principles come from the field of cognitive metaphor and embodied cognition. They were first developed in the 1980’s by George Lakoff and Mark Johnson who since have written numerous books on it, and it’s becomes a major area of research in cognitive science.\n\nThese books, Metaphors We Live By and Philosophy in the Flesh are two of the major texts.\n\nSo I can’t go too deep into this now, but if you’re curious to learn more these are worth checking out\n\n\u003cBasicImage\n  width=\"900\"\n  src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dxj9qr5gj/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto,q_auto:good,w_1100/v1639242314/maggieappleton.com/notes/programming-pictures/PicturesProgramming-30_n1taw4.jpg\"\n  alt=\"Book covers of Metaphors We Live By and Philosophy in the Flesh\"\n/\u003e\n\nJust like every other abstract topic that we can’t see or touch, programming relies heavily on these physical, embodied metaphors.\n\nWe have to, because programming itself is a game of abstractions. When we run a JavaScript file, what we’re really doing is telling a microchip to flip a bunch of logic gates using tiny electrical pulses.\n\nProgramming tiny logic gates is very tedious and difficult for human\n\nSo we’ve developed a stack of elaborate metaphors that it faster and easier.\n\n\u003cBasicImage\n  width=\"900\"\n  src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dxj9qr5gj/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto,q_auto:good,w_1100/v1639241183/maggieappleton.com/notes/programming-pictures/PicturesProgramming-32_qfotzf.jpg\"\n  alt=\"A graphic showing the stack of metaphors we use to understand programming concepts\"\n/\u003e\n\nSome people might prefer to call these abstractions, but for the purposes of this talk, assume metaphors and abstractions are roughly the same thing.\nWe can debate the differences later on twitter.\n\nWe simplify our binary code into machine code, which is simplified into higher-level languages like JavaScript, which we simplify with GUIs.\n\nAnd at every step of this process, we’re trying to make the abstract machine world resemble our tangible, human world.\n\nBecause the closer we move towards intuitive, embodied knowledge in the upper right-hand side of this scale, the easier it becomes for us to understand what’s happening in a system.\n\nComponents in React are a great example of one of these embodied metaphors in action.\n\n\u003cBasicImage\n  width=\"900\"\n  src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dxj9qr5gj/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto,q_auto:good,w_1100/v1639241190/maggieappleton.com/notes/programming-pictures/PicturesProgramming-33_phzfom.jpg\"\n  alt=\"An illustraton of a component as a box-shaped container\"\n/\u003e\n\nComponents are essentially containers – they hold sets of UI elements for us.\n\nSo a card component might have an image, and a button, and a paragraph inside of it that it holds.\n\nNow the CPU that’s eventually going to render this component on the screen knows nothing about containers. It only knows machine code and how to make the right pixels light up.\n\nThe container is a metaphor that we humans need in order to manage and organise the code we write.\n\nYou the only reason you know what a container is, is because as a child, you dumped sand into a bucket and poured it out again. This interaction with the physical world, of learning through embodied experience, taught you that containers hold things. That they have insides and outsides.

As a cultural anthropologist, the beliefs, norms, and social dynamics of Reactland have always been more intriguing to me than the useEffect hook or concurrent mode.\n\n### What is cultural anthropology?\n\nIf you have never head of \"**cultural anthropology**,\" don't worry. That's expected. It doesn’t often overlap with the world of web development and as a discipline it's not great at self-promotion.\n\nIt's essentially the study of human cultures and trying to understand how they work.\n\nOr as one of my favourite anthropologists [Tim Ingold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Ingold) puts it:\n\n\u003cBasicImage\n  width=\"880px\"\n  alt=\"Cultural anthropology is philosophy with the people in it\"\n  src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dg3gyk0gu/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto,q_auto:good,w_1200/v1597334937/maggieappleton.com/notes/anthropology-react-slides/ReactRally2020-Draft1.012.png\"\n/\u003e\n\n\u003cSubtext\u003e\n\nFrom [Anthropology: Why it Matters](/anthropology-matters)\n\n\u003c/Subtext\u003e\n\nAnthropology tries to answer many of the same questions philosophers concern themselves with;\n\n_Why do we have language?\nHow should we organise our societies and institutions?\nHow do we deal with birth, death, morality, and conflict?_\n\nPhilosophers turn inwards to find these answers. They go into a small quiet room alone, think a lot, and read books by mostly old dead white men to find answers.\n\nIn contrast, Anthropology turns outwards - **it looks for the answers in people.** By living among them, learning from them, and taking part in their lives. A process known as [Participant Observation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participant_observation).\n\nIt isn't searching for one universal truth of all humanity, but rather **particular truths for particular people**, at particular points in time.\n\n---\n\n### Why care about the anthropology of React?\n\nLooking at React through a cultural lens helps us understand it as more than simply **\"a JavaScript library for building user interfaces\"**.\n\nTechnical definitions can be reductive - they draw a technological box around our concepts that hide the historical and cultural context.\n\n\u003cBasicImage\n  width=\"880px\"\n  alt=\"The react logo inside a strict technical box\"\n  src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dg3gyk0gu/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto,q_auto:good,w_1200/v1597334929/maggieappleton.com/notes/anthropology-react-slides/ReactRally2020-Draft1.008.png\"\n/\u003e\n\nWhat happens if we expand our understanding to include all the people who surround this React, and how they might **affect** and **be affected by** what's inside it?\n\n\u003cBasicImage\n  width=\"880px\"\n  alt=\"An expanded circle of all the people of react\"\n  src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dg3gyk0gu/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto,q_auto:good,w_1200/v1597334932/maggieappleton.com/notes/anthropology-react-slides/ReactRally2020-Draft1.010.png\"\n/\u003e\n\nWhat if we entertain the idea that humans and the culture of React are an essential part of what defines React? What if we consider it a cultural ecosystem we're _active participants_ in, rather than simply a package we `npm install`\n\nCultural anthropology is perfectly placed to help us find answers to these questions.\n\n---\n\n### Understanding the \"The React Community\"\n\nWe should establish who we’re talking about when we say “the react community” - where do we think the boundaries of the React community are, and who do we think is part of it?\n\n\u003cBasicImage\n  width=\"880px\"\n  alt=\"How do we define the React community?\"\n  src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dg3gyk0gu/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto,q_auto:good,w_1200/v1597334943/maggieappleton.com/notes/anthropology-react-slides/ReactRally2020-Draft1.014.png\"\n/\u003e\n\nI drew a very incomplete and fuzzy map of the React world here. It’s definitely not comprehensive or to scale.\n\n\u003cimg\n  alt=\"A hand drawn map of the react community\"\n  src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dg3gyk0gu/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto,q_auto:good,w_1200/v1597334948/maggieappleton.com/notes/anthropology-react-slides/ReactRally2020-Draft1.015.png\"\n/\u003e\n\nI drew this to point out two key things.\nFirst, being a React person isn’t a mutually exclusive identity - you can be other things too.\n\nWe have many overlapping and neighbouring communities we all belong to. You might also be part of the Data Viz world, or hang out within a sub niche like React Native.\n\nSecond, our community has very fluid boundaries. People flow in and out quite easily – anyone who finds it can join. To become a member you didn’t need to fill out a form and send it to a committee, or go through an initiation ceremony.\n\nYou also have the freedom to leave whenever you like.\n\nThese fuzzy boundaries sometimes make us a little bit anxious - it's hard to know who's part of the group, and weakens our sense of being a cohesive whole.\n\nAnother way to try and understand the React community is to look at some rough numbers.\n\n\u003cBasicImage\n  width=\"880px\"\n  alt=\"Stats on how many React developers participate in Github, Reddit, and Dsicord groups\"\n  src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dg3gyk0gu/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto,q_auto:good,w_1200/v1597334954/maggieappleton.com/notes/anthropology-react-slides/ReactRally2020-Draft1.016.png\"\n/\u003e\n\nThese are interesting indicators, but they're not necessarily helpful if we're primarily interested in how React works as a cultural system.\n\n---\n\n### React is an Imagined Community\n\nRather than talking about stats and numbers, it’s much more meaningful for us to talk about React an an [imagined community](/imagined-communities)\n\nThis was a concept developed by a political scientist called [Benedict Anderson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benedict_Anderson) in the 1980’s.\n\nAnderson was writing about how nations imagine themselves as collective wholes, but his theory maps very well to how online communities like React work.\n\nAn imagined community has nothing to do with it being imaginary in the sense of being fake, but simply that it’s something we have to mentally construct across thousands of individual minds. It gets built through shared images and rituals.\n\nAnderson specifically uses the idea of a national daily newspaper.\n\nThe act of sitting down and reading the daily news, and imagining a whole nation of other people, similar like you, sitting and reading those exact same words at roughly the same time, creates a sense of collective belonging.\n\nIt’s a daily ritual that reaffirms your membership, and sense of unity with a greater whole.\n\n\u003cComingSoon /\u003e\n","data":{"title":"The Cultural Anthropology of React","description":"A cultural analysis of the native behaviour of React developers","startDate":"2020-08-18","updated":"2021-11-11","type":"note","topics":["Talks","React","Anthropology","JavaScript"],"growthStage":"budding"},"slug":"anthropology-react","filePath":"anthropology-react.mdx"},{"content":"\n[Jared Pereira](https://awarm.space/) has been running a wonderful series of personal [website tours](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEXbN99LY3OCarUeXcxWeZzOelXQvVdAA).

It challenges many of our default anthropocentric attitudes towards the world.\n\nThese emerging relationships with technology are indicative of those going on within our greater society. Quantified Selfers should be considered the frontier of those fully embracing these new embodiments.\n\nThey construct new identities and ways of being through technology, especially through the medium of data.\n\nMassive **troves of immaterial online information become representations of selves in the public sphere**, as well as potential channels for manipulation and domination on a socio-political level.\n\nThough many have read the data-collection practices of the Quantified Self community as solely self-surveillance, we find they are actually **choosing to generate and control their own information** rather than wait for greater social and political forces to do it for them.\n\nWe are now all implicated in acts of self-quantification and the rise of data-selves by nature of being digitally connected.\n\nA state which raises a plethora of political and personal complications for us to navigate.\n\nIf we are already intertwined in a system of data surveillance, **self-trackers may be the ones turning the system into a source of identity, positive meaning and empowerment.**\n\n---\n\nThough they are politically resistant in the field of data surveillance, their underlying ideologies still inherently tie them to fulfilling the needs of a capitalist economy.\n\n\u003e They strive to be optimal citizens: organised, productive, timely, fit, and responsible, giving off the social perception of a well-ordered and lived life.\n\nThis pursuit is driven by **a conviction in the natural goodness of capitalism** that resembles religious belief, yet one that fails to result in the transcendent state implicitly promised.\n\nThe existence of the Quantified Self movement, a collection of individuals seeking to improve and upgrade themselves in order to manage the unreasonably demanding requirements of the capitalist economy using the same ideological base that brought it into being, should lead us to critically question what they mean by seeking “improvement” in the interests of “progress.”\n\n**We should ask what we they progressing towards and whether it truly serves their own interests.**\n\n---\n\nThroughout this critical exploration, and despite the occasional bold conclusion, I do not mean to “other” the Quantified Selfers.\n\nWhen taken in cultural context, **their practices and beliefs are reasonable and rational**. The ways we enact these same beliefs are simply more familiar to us – we have been performing them for so long they do not seem alien or absurd to our eyes.\n\nAmassing, meticulously graphing, and developing formulas based on the data points of a morning routine puts these convictions into such a stark light that we react with shock, and often quickly move to ridicule those who practice it.\n\n**Out of a lack of empathetic understanding (and perhaps some confusion and fear), many have defaulted to portraying Quantified Selfers as a misguided, fringe population** numerically desecrating the sanctity of the human self.\n\nMy research explores and challenges both this inaccurate portrayal of the community, as well as the notion that we have a sacred pre-defined “human nature” in need of defending.\n\nThe movement is not what many take it as.\n\n\u003e They are often holistically humanistic rather than reductively mechanical, diverse rather than monolithic, evolving and dynamic rather than static, and critically questioning rather than passively complying.\n\nAbove all other qualities, I found the Quantified Self movement to be **defined by a diversity and complexity of opinions**.\n\nMembers expressed wide varieties of dynamic, evolving ideas and contradictory ideologies. To study, think, and write about the movement as a whole concept and bound community was a challenging and confusing task on numerous occasions.\n\nDespite these rifts and differences, the Quantified Self community indeed shares fundamental and core beliefs about the value of self- improvement through quantified self-knowledge, providing them with enough common ground to engage in building a meaningful social world.\n\n---\n\n## Chapter One - An Introduction to the Quantified Self\n\n\u003cTwoColumn maxWidth=\"800px\" justifyItems=\"start\"\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\n\nHeart rate: 67bpm.  \nBlood pressure: 110/74.  \nBlood-oxygenation: 97%.  \nWeight: 126.3lbs.  \nHours of sleep: 7.23.  \nQuality of sleep: 83%.  \nREM cycles: 5.\n\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\n\nCaffeine intake: 126mg.  \nSteps taken: 2,405.  \nCalories expended: 809.  \nEmails received: 54.  \nEmails sent: 13.  \nMotivation level: 4.  \nStress level: 7.3.\n\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003c/TwoColumn\u003e\n\nLocation: the world of the Quantified Self – the self understood and expressed through numbers, data, and quantified statistics.\n\nSummed up by their tagline “self-knowledge through numbers,” the concept of the “Quantified Self” encompasses a both a cultural ideology and a community of people – who congregate both online and offline – that ascribe to it (Quantified Self 2013).\n\nThis distinction between the Quantified Self movement or phenomenon, and the Quantified Self community is an important one.\n\nThere is an understanding of a greater “movement” taking place on a social level, believed to be a historical force in itself, with some trackers even calling it “our millennium’s renaissance” (Top Coder Inc 2012).\n\nThe movement is driven by specific and historically-located ideas and beliefs guiding this technologically-oriented approach to self-tracking. With it comes an international community whose members self- identify and connect through self-tracking.\n\n---\n\n#### Self-Tracking\n\nWhat members of this community hold in common is the practice of self-tracking: they collect and store data and information about particular aspects of their life and self.\n\nThis practice revolves around designing projects that target specific variables. The kind of things that people choose to track is seemingly infinite – ranging from the common areas of sleep, time, physical exercise, and food intake, to the more creative variable of monitoring of Twitter activity, shower temperatures, snoring, and perceived quality of social conversations (Quantified Self 2013).\n\nIt is a running joke within the community that any aspect of life you can imagine being tracked, probably is being tracked a Quantified Selfer somewhere in the world.\n\nKeeping tabs on the self is nothing terribly new: Benjamin Franklin is one historical figure known to have written of his adherence to thirteen key values each day (Dembosky 2011). \u003cFootnote idName={1}\u003eThere now exists an iPhone application where you too can track Franklin’s thirteen prescribed virtues over the course of your day.\u003c/Footnote\u003e\n\nSelf-trackers often like to harken back to such historical individuals, attempting to convey the message that surveying the self in pursuit of improvement has been a noble and worthwhile activity for hundreds of years (Kelly 2012b).\n\nThe practice seems to have been an especially prevalent theme in the history of Western culture, appearing everywhere from religious virtues to nationalistic demands of responsible citizenship.\n\nAppreciating the influence of these historically-based ideas on the current Quantified Self movement is central to understanding how and why it has emerged.\n\nIn many ways that is part of the real significance of this movement: self-tracking has long been a part of ourselves and our cultures.\n\nIt is a practice that all of us can relate to, and engage with in small ways – one that is not only growing rapidly, but also shifting forms.\n\nAdvancements in technology have now infinitely expanded the realm of self-tracking – making the practice exponentially easier compared to the old pen-and-paper method. From body monitors to smartphone applications, we are now enabling a new age of the measured self.\n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n#### History and Founding\n\nThe Quantified Self movement does not begin or end with any single individual or set of people.\n\nInstead of being “founded,” its origin story is told as a natural emergence out of the way human interaction with technology is already taking shape.\n\nIt would be more accurate to say certain leaders emerged who encouraged and facilitated the rise of the culture, shaping the phenomenon by giving it a name and a central digital space where they could communicate, organise, and establish their identity.\n\nThese leaders were Gary Wolf and Kevin Kelly who set up Quantifiedself.com – the website acting as the online hub of the movement.\n\nThe two were journalists already invested in exploring the social and personal meanings behind technology when they met as co-workers at the forward-thinking magazine Wired in 2007.\n\nOne an editor and one a writer, they began to collaborate over their shared interest in a technologically-driven trend both had noticed gaining ground among their social circles in the bay area of California; “people subjecting themselves to regimes of quantitative measurement and self-tracking that went far beyond the ordinary” (Wolf 2010b).\n\nThey attribute the rise of these habits to four factors:\n\n- The growing ubiquity of personal mobile devices – allowing people to carry powerful computing capacities around in their pockets\n- Advances in the quality, affordability and miniaturisation of electronic body sensors and tracking tools\n- Social media’s normalisation of perpetually sharing intimate information; and the rise of “the digital cloud”\n- The massive increase in capacity of online data hosting and storage, making its collection seem immaterially infinite. (Wolf 2010a; Kelly 2011)\n\nBy 2008, the community had grown enough for Kelly and Wolf to feel they needed to establish a supportive limited liability company: Quantified Self Labs (Quantified Self 2013).\n\nActing as an organisational support, the structure of the company is simple. There are no full time employees and they have a stated goal of “not making organising QS feel like work” (Butterfield 2012:16).\n\nThe community aims to promote an egalitarian and democratic power structure by downplaying officiality and hierarchy.\n\n#### Community Organisation\n\nThe community aspect of the Quantified Self movement is intentional and active; bounded together by voluntary, self-expressed membership, they connect through online hubs that typically include forum posts, twitter conversations, blog entries with streams of discussion comments, and informative resource pages such as wikis. On the central website Quantifiedself.com, they define themselves as a “collaboration of users and tool-makers who share an interest in self-knowledge through self-tracking” (Quantified Self 2013).\n\nAs of April 2013, there are currently 111 registered meet-up groups consisting of 18,558 members across 31 nations in 89 cities–these mini-communities are represented in New York, San Francisco, London and Tokyo, and also extend to places such as Rio de Janeiro, Bangkok, Beijing and Cape Town (Meetup 2013). However, as a geographical trend, the the vast majority of tracking communities are condensed within the Global North.\n\nMeet-ups are regularly scheduled, organised events where members can share their stories of self-experimentation. Run through the website Meetup.com, each geographical area has local voluntary leaders who facilitate the monthly gatherings. These meetings centre around a series of slide-show presentations, called “show-and-tells,” which are usually filmed and later uploaded to internet blogs and websites (Christensen 2013).\n\nAnthropologist Adam Butterfield conducted his master’s thesis specifically on Quantified Self community meet-up groups and succinctly defined their content as “personal stories of self-tracking projects” (Butterfield 2012). While this is a simplified description of how the ideology gets communicated between its members and the general public, in a literal sense its is fairly accurate.\n\nThe emphasis on storytelling using meaningful data is a key component of the Quantified Self movement. Understanding how and why these stories are told is central to understanding the Quantified Self movement and the cultural forces driving and shaping it.\n\nThroughout this thesis I will cite many tracking tales told through blog posts, personal websites, filmed presentations, and second-hand accounts in articles.\n\nAt meet-up presenters are advised to base their talk around three prime questions; first, explain what you did; second, explain how you did it; and third, explain what you learnt (Wolf 2011). Some meet-up communities further structure the story-telling form by suggesting that speakers limit their talks to five minutes, encouraging simple and clear communication (Christensen 2013). The purpose of these presentations is to offer ideas that others might spark inspiration from: different tools and methods for self-tracking, different variables to track, inventive solutions to common problems like trouble sleeping or stress at work.\n\nThe movement sees themselves as trying to cultivate a “culture of sharing” (Christensen 2013). The ultimate value they share is seeking self-improvement, and through sharing stories, hope to collaboratively encourage and support one another in that goal. Conferences follow a similar structure but are much larger events, usually drawing members from all over a region (such as Europe or the Pacific Northwest) instead of a single city.\n\nThe glue holding this community together is undeniably the website Quantifiedself.com. Much like an ever-expanding family tree, it branches outwards connecting a seemingly infinite number of links to online data logging tools, company pages for commercially produced tracking devices and services, YouTube and Vimeo videos of presentations, reviews of smartphone tracking applications, notable personal blogs of self-trackers, and relevant journalistic and academic articles. It is the central hub of this internet-based society.\n\nQuantifiedself.com features many aspects typical of websites that facilitate open and interactive online societies; social forums, active commenting on blog postings, occasional surveys, prompts for open discussions, frequent guest writers, and interviews with notable community members (Quantified Self 2013).\n\nThis includes a number of recurring features such as: “What We’re Reading” – a compiled list of the latest publications and articles related to the Quantified Self movement, “Toolmaker Talks” – question and answer posts with the developers of popular tracking devices and applications, and “Numbers from Around the Web” – a showcase of especially interesting self-experiments and the resulting data from community members (Quantified Self 2013).\n\nThis small slice of what type of content is posted should make apparent this website is by no means written or controlled by a single or small handful of individuals.\n\n\u003c!--\nWhile Kevin Kelly, Gary Wolf, and Alexandria Carmichael are the official moderators, the\nmajority of the material is generated from a large and diverse number of contributors. 2\n\n2 Alexandria Carmichael is also the director of Quantified Self Labs, and co-founded the health tracking website CureTogether; a health care company “that brings patients with hundreds of conditions together in overlapping data communities” (CureTogether 2013).\n\nBeing an online social group, the nature of the Quantified Self community is fairly fluid with members interacting over “multisited situations with complex, spatially diverse” geographies (Wilson and Peterson 2002:455). In their review of the Anthropology of Online Communities, Wilson and Peterson point out that they are likely to be bound by “asymmetrical, indirect connections,” as people are able to identify with the idea of being part of the community without necessarily making direct personal connections with others (Wilson and Peterson 2002:455). They may simply feel engagement and membership by reading the thoughts and ideas of other members on websites and blogs. The practices of connection can sometimes be socially passive. This quality makes the Quantified Self community an imagined community, a concept developed by political scientist Benedict Anderson to describe a socially-constructed unit where its members understand themselves to be part of a bound whole even in the absence of face-to- face interactions or social events. Becoming part of a community simply requires they imagine themselves to be so, much like being a member of a nation (Anderson 1991). However, in the case of the Quantified Self community, there are also many socially active and physically interactive ways members are bound together. Though geographically spread out over nations and internet cables, there is still a face-to-face aspect of the Quantified Self community in their regularly organised physical meet-ups and conferences. Quantified Self has been described as “a grass-roots movement brought together by the internet” (Harrell 2011), emphasising its nature as democratic and community-driven. This strengthens their resemblance to traditional, localised communities where members are more likely to make direct and personal connections with one another.\n\n\nLeadership, Power Structures \u0026 Cohesion\nAlthough Kevin Kelly and Gary Wolf are often referred to as the “leaders” of the movement, the community tries to cultivate an open and democratic power structure where no single person or set of people speak for everyone. There are, however, many members who are more outspoken and active in publishing ideological writings on the Quantified Self, sometimes referred to as “thought leaders” (Erwin 2012). These are individuals who usually run high-traffic blogs about their Quantified Self lifestyles, regularly publishing advice, reflections, and generally contributing content to the online community and the discussions happening within it. Quantified Selfers may not exactly align their tracking beliefs and habits with members who might be considered “popular” (who themselves hold a diverse range of beliefs around self- tracking), yet these individuals may have greater power and sway within the community thanks to their ability to influence the opinions of their readers. These informal leaders are frequently featured in interviews, articles, and publications about the movement. They appear to be prominent and well-respected figures within the community, with smaller self-tracking blogs frequently referring to and citing them in posts. However, they should not themselves be taken as absolute representations of the movement, nor should they be assumed to speak on behalf of the entire community (Erwin 2012). In his ethnographic work, Butterfield found it is certainly “not a monolithic community where everyone involved shares the same ideas about, and interests in, self-tracking” (Butterfield 212:49). Though Kelly and Wolf may have run the first Quantified Self meet-up, both believe the movement has “taken on a life of its own, and in some ways, taken on a different meaning” (Butterfield 2012:16). The Quantified Self ideology itself has evolved in its short six year history, with different philosophies, values, and areas of focus rising and falling in popularity – none consistent throughout or representative of the whole community, but fluctuating and developing through community discussions and dialogues. Above all other qualities of the movement, this lack of deterministic authority and communal openness to change maturation, and development of what it means to be a “Quantified Selfer” might be of the most seminal importance to understanding it authentically.\n\n\n\nOn Ethnographic Sources\nThe vast majority of my ethnographic material is drawn from blog postings, essays, interviews in journalistic publications and newspapers, and filmed presentations created by people who make up the dedicated core of the movement. They are the leaders and avid participants, the organisers and enthusiasts, the writers and researchers. You will notice a repetition of names throughout my work: individuals like Kevin Kelly, Gary Wolf, Ernesto Ramirez, Konstantin Augemberg, Larry Smarr, gwern branwen [sic], and Buster Benson, among others, are all continuously cited across its chapters. The dominance of their voices is due to the dominance of their influence across the Quantified Self community, and the extensive efforts they put into writing and publishing about it. I recognise that this leaves my analysis vulnerable as an inaccurate representation of the more common or “typical” Quantified Selfer who may not widely promote their beliefs and philosophies about self-tracking in publicly accessible places. However, there is no “normal” when it comes to the Quantified Self movement – its membership is characterised by a wide diversity of opinions, habits, and levels of involvement. I have done my best to cast my net wide in selecting blogs, recorded talks, and stories to quote from and analyse – presenting accounts ranging the “thought leaders” who upload every detail of their day to public websites, to those who have only dabbled in a single experiment of self-quantification. Yet I concede my sources are limited to those who have chosen to freely share their experiences over the internet, a potentially self-selecting group. I have also likely left out the voices of many slightly less prominent “thought leaders,” simply by limitation of the sheer number of them heading up different factions of the community, and that their opinions overlapped with those already represented. I have to some degree relied on the insights of anthropologists who are able to be physically present at Quantified Self meet-ups and conferences, primarily the work of Dawn Nafus and Jamie Sherman, and Adam Butterfield. Their expressed insights about the community, after engaging with people face-to-face and conducting many interviews, I believe grants them considerable legitimacy as second-hand ethnographic sources. --\u003e\n\u003c!--\n\nThe Self-Tracker Identity\nIdentifying as a “Quantified Selfer” (the predominant self-referentially used term) requires two things; first, a lifestyle based around tracking data about oneself, and second, a conscious willingness to identity as such 3\n\n3  Throughout this thesis I will use the terms “Quantified Selfer,” “Self Quantifier,” “quantifier,” “self- tracker,” and “tracker” interchangeably. This is based on the way I found those five terms to be used within the ethnographic material of the Quantified Self community. For the purposes of this paper you should assume they all refer to the same social identity being discussed here.\n\nBeing an identified Quantified Selfer is voluntary and self-assigned. An ownership of their tracking activity as a significant aspect of who they believe themselves to be. It is a public expression of a set of values and ideals that privately can hold a wide variety of meanings. Beyond the core belief in seeking self-improvement through collecting data, the rest is left up to the individual: track what you want, how you want, and do what you like with the data (Wolf 2010a). This open-ended invitation to have total agency of your own self-tracking lifestyle makes involvement and membership in the movement exceedingly undefined. What exactly it means to be a Quantified Selfer falls on a wide spectrum, and there are degrees to which a person can identify with and be involved in the community. Those who present at conferences and actively organise meet-ups likely take the identity more seriously than those who simply wear a popular commercial tracking device and occasionally read the Quantifiedself.com blog posts. Essentially, the level of involvement is flexible and the line between being a Quantified Selfer or not is fuzzy at best. This grey-area around what counts as being a “member” of the tracking movement requires some clarification as to who exactly I am discussing in this research. Therefore, I wish to clarify that am considering the baseline of membership to be an explicit, public and purposeful ownership of being a Quantified Selfer\n\nDespite the wide variety of forms being a Quantified Selfer can take, and the insistence by community members that there is no such thing as an “average” self-tracker, they certainly perceive a certain type of person to be drawn to the movement (Augemberg 2013a). They describe people who join as “curious” and “goal-oriented or problem-solving\noriented” (Christensen 2013). Many come from a science-minded perspective and are interested in “poking, prodding, and measuring as a way to go about the world” (Cornell 2010). Though inspired by scientific curiosity, they also revel in questioning existing mainstream social institutions like biomedicine and technoscience, believing their practices go against the grain of “normal” society. They repeatedly speak about themselves in narratives and terms that imply independence, difference, rebelliousness, radical thinking, and being defiant of the status quo, such as being self-proclaimed “pioneers” (Kelly 2011; Wolf 2010a). Joining the movement seems to be more likely if you possess these certain character traits, but community members also suggest being part of the movement strengthens these qualities and subsequently changes the kind of lives people lead. Augemberg argues that the practice of self-tracking, Quantified Selfers become “different from other people with regard to mentality, psychological traits, lifestyle, and behaviours” (Augemberg 2013a). There is no doubt the movement understands itself as a social collective of like-minded individuals sharing an established set of values, qualifying them as a community.\n\n\n\nShifting Norms\nBack in 2010 – the relative “early years” of the movement – Wolf wrote of extreme quantifiers considering their behaviour to be “abnormal,” and calling themselves “outliers” (Wolf 2010a). While the community still associates with leading lifestyles that deviate from the norm, many are experiencing a shift in the previously bizarre becoming more acceptable. Compulsive recordings of bodily numbers are no longer necessarily characterised as some form of anxiety disorder or signal of a lack of mental stability (Wolf 2010a). Still, in his ethnography Butterfield found self-trackers reported reluctance to divulge the full extent their tracking habits to those outside the movement, fearing they may be stigmatised and labeled “obsessive compulsive, self- absorbed, or a hypochondriac” (Butterfield 2012: 60). They report others in their lives label them “weird,” and yet simultaneously are assured that “soon everybody is going to be doing this, and you won’t even notice” (Wolf 2010a). The movement’s expansion seemingly instills confience that greater social acceptance is on the way. It therefore greatly serves the interests of those within the movement to promote the self-tracking lifestyle as increasingly normal and ordinary.\nMany of the outspoken leaders of the movement are, naturally, quite optimistic about its potential rising popularity. Kelly sees the next century as leading us into an age of quantification; he believes industry will spur a new side to science and a new kind of lifestyle. He sees “new money, new tools, and a new philosophy stemming from measuring your whole life... It will be the new normal” (Kelly 2011). As this shift continues, it creates an interesting interplay with the dominant narratives that Quantified Selfers tell themselves about being “pioneering self- trackers” (Kelly 2011). How they will maintain this core aspect of their collective identity if indeed their prediction of going mainstream is fulfilled remains to be seen.\n\n\nSelf-Producing Pioneers\nFittingly, one intriguing quality of Quantified Selfers is the high number who are also the creators, inventors, and developers of self-tracking tools. In line with their philosophy of self- customisation and personalisation in the practice of self-tracking, it makes sense that many feel it is worth developing their own tools to serve their own specific interests and needs. Described as “technophiles, founders, and early adopters,” they engage in both the production and the use of their technological tools – a continuous, circular feedback system (Dembosky 2011; Maqubela 2012). As most work in the industry of producing technological goods, they already have the skills and knowledge to do so. The New York meet-up survey cited earlier found that 30% of their members either work for a self-tracking related company or have created a self- quantification tool (Paulus 2013). Being both the creators and consumers of cutting edge tools and technological advancements legitimises their “pioneer” self-image to an extent. They closely follow not only the new commodified gadgets and software applications that emerge on the market, but also the advances in computational power systems one step removed from the public eye – inventions that could lead to possible new ways of integrating technologies into the self. They are inventing entirely new devices to integrate into their bodies, leading the frontier of technological development in an effort to be even more enmeshed in the digital age of enhancement. In this role they are shaping the forms and purposes of the technology that “trickles down” to the rest of us in the mainstream hordes of technological consumerism. We should especially care about what they find significant, important, and meaningful - because to an extent they hold the power to determine what kind of technology we will use, and what we will use it for. There are concerns that should be raised around this form of power, especially considering the limited demographic of WEIRD individuals that currently make up the majority of the community. The political and social repercussions in areas such as healthcare and access across socioeconomic lines will be expanded upon later on.\n\n\n --\u003e\n","data":{"title":"Tracking Humanity","description":"The introduction to my thesis on the Quantified Self movement and the culture of self-tracking","aliases":["quantified self","Quantified Self"],"updated":"2021-10-12","startDate":"2020-05-12","type":"note","topics":["Embodiment","Anthropology","Data"],"growthStage":"seedling"},"slug":"tracking-humanity","filePath":"tracking-humanity.mdx"},{"content":"\n\u003cIntroParagraph\u003e\n\nMy obsession with metaphor isn't original, it's genetically inherited.

They're just supporting material that help clarify the most important ideas.\n\nFirst up is a **big picture view** showing all the essential parts of a Gatsby site.\n\n\u003cBasicImage\n  alt=\"Gatsby is a collection of tools for building static sites\"\n  src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dg3gyk0gu/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto,q_auto:best,w_1200/v1597741851/maggieappleton.com/egghead-course-notes/intro-gatsby/IntroGatsby_1_Small.png\"\n/\u003e\n\nGatsby sites are able to pull in data from multiple sources all at once. This includes REST API endpoints, classic content management systems like [Wordpress](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/guides/wordpress/) or [Contentful](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/blog/2018-1-25-building-a-site-with-react-and-contentful/), or just your local file system.\n\nThese are pulled in through [GraphQL](https://www.graphql.com/), which acts as a _transportation layer_.\n\n[Node.js](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/glossary/node/) is the main engine inside a Gatsby site which generates the pages, nodes, and metadata.\n\nAnd finally [React](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/glossary/react/) creates all the user interface elements.\n\n### Page Queries vs. Static Queries\n\nOnce people wrap their heads around the structure of a Gatsby project, GraphQL is usually one the first sticking points.\n\nIf you've never worked with it before, the syntax looks very odd and it's hard to tell what it's doing.\n\nIt gets more confusing to learn there are _two types of queries_ - **page queries** and **static queries**\n\n\u003cBasicImage\n  alt=\"Diagram of a pageQuery request inside a page, and a static query request inside a component\"\n  src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dg3gyk0gu/image/upload/v1597741854/maggieappleton.com/egghead-course-notes/intro-gatsby/IntroGatsby_2_Small.png\"\n/\u003e\n\nIt only seems complex on the surface, but it's easy to distinguish these two. Most of your queries will be page queries – these live inside your page files like `blog.js` or `about.js`\n\nStatic queries go inside individual component files like `Navbar.js` or `Footer.js`. There's also a handy React hook to handle these for us: [useStaticQuery](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/use-static-query/)\n\n### Progressive Enhancement\n\nOne of the main benefits of a Gatsby site is it uses a technique called **Progressive Enhancement** to render pages.\n\n\u003cBasicImage\n  alt=\"Animation of a page rendering static HTML elements first, then being updates with React afterwards\"\n  src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dg3gyk0gu/image/upload/v1597741856/maggieappleton.com/egghead-course-notes/intro-gatsby/IntroGatsby_3_Animation.gif\"\n/\u003e\n\nThis is what makes Gatsby page look like they load quickly. The lightweight static HTML version appears first, and then heavier files and interactive elements are layered on afterwards.\n\nReact handles any changes and user interactions.

Textual programming is the water we swim in. We express computation logic in written text because that must naturally and obviously the best medium for it. At least, this is what we tell ourselves from the vantage point of people who have only ever lived in a textual programming world.\n\nWhat, exactly, might be the alternative to programming in pure text? Am I suggesting we interpretive dance our way through a function that prints out the Fibonacci sequence?\n\nNot exactly. Although I would like to see someone try.\n\nWhat I want to explore here is the relative **lack of visuals, graphics, and spatial design** in our current programming environments. While we've crafted widely accessible graphical user interfaces (GUIs) for everyone else, programmers remain in the land of typed commands. As the mediators between meatspace and binary logic, we don't get to click buttons, drag sliders, pan canvases, or select options from dropdown menus while we build. Instead, we type.\n\nThere are plenty of good reasons for this – both historical and logical – that we'll get into. Understanding how we ended up in this purely textual place is a necessary first step if we want to question it.\n\n\u003cSpacer size=\"small\" /\u003e\n\n## Inventing the End User\n\nIn the early 1980's a wide new divide opened up. With the rise of personal computing and the arrival of accessible machines like the Macintosh, we created a clear distinction between \"programmers\" and \"end users.\" Before that point, the people who designed and wrote computer programmes were primarily the same people who used computer programmes. You couldn't do much of one without the other.\n\nAnd all of these people were exclusively using text to talk to their machines. Because it was the only show in town.\n\nThe aesthetic of bright green blocky text on black terminals isn't just a fun, retro media trope – our pre-GUI interfaces geuinely looked like this.\n\n\u003cBasicImage\n  src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dxj9qr5gj/image/upload/v1631569504/maggieappleton.com/notes/learnable-programming/oldinterfaces_shrink_ul4wep.png\"\n  alt={\n    \u003cspan\u003e\n      Interfaces used between 1980-1990; courtesy of{\" \"}\n      \u003ca href=\"https://betawiki.net/\"\u003ebetawiki.net\u003c/a\u003e\n    \u003c/span\u003e\n  }\n  imageWidth=\"1200px\"\n  showalt\n/\u003e\n\nBefore the 1980's showed up with its neon leg warmers and big hair, most computers _didn't even have screens_. You blindly typed commands onto a keyboard that punched holes into paper.\n\n\u003cDraft /\u003e\n\nMany, many programmers will argue programming in linear text is simply _better_. And they're not entirely wrong. Textual notation is an extremely efficient way to condense meaning. It's quick to write and allows us to create precise abstractions other programmers can interpret and work with.\n\nBy _graphical_ I mean any arrangement of shapes (square, circle, irregular nonagon, what have you) in space that aren't written words.\n\nBy _spatial_ I mean the way we use our understanding of being a body with a front, back, left, right, up, and down, to understand the world around us.\n\nHumans are exceptionally skilled at spatial thinking.\n\nUsing visual representations like maps, diagrams, and shapes in 2D / 3D space to communicate meaning is something we've been doing far longer than we've been typing text into screens. About 43,832 years longer. \u003cFootnote idName={2}\u003eTaking the 43,900 y.a. hunting scenes \u003ca href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1806-y\"\u003efound\u003c/a\u003e in Sulawesi, Indonesia as a conservative marker of when we first started doing pictorial storytelling on surfaces around us\u003c/Footnote\u003e Given all that time, humans are much better at reasoning using graphical and spatial mappings than they are with linear abstract text.\n\nI am certainly not to first to find it odd. People have been harping on about the limitations of textual programming since the beginning of programming. These complainers tend to gather under the umbrella of **Visual Programming** – a field that encompasses so many efforts and projects it's hard to figure out what it wants.\n\n\u003cSpacer size=\"small\" /\u003e\n\n## What is Visual Programming?\n\nGood question.\n\nThe name itself is a bit of a misnomer since anything we see with our eyes technically counts as _visual._ Which would certainly include linear text. When people use the term they are usually referring to some kind of **spatial** or **graphical** programming environment.\n\n\u003cSpacer size=\"small\" /\u003e\n\n## Visual Programming for Learnable Programming\n\nBret Victor coined the term \u003cb\u003eLearnable Programming\u003c/b\u003e in his \u003ca href=\"http://worrydream.com/LearnableProgramming\"\u003ecanonical essay\u003c/a\u003e lamenting the current state of programming education. Bret has a few concerns with the way most of us learn to code. Mainly that the learning environments we drop people into are poorly designed.\n\nThese environments tend to look something like this:\n\n\u003cTwoColumn\u003e\n\n\u003cimg\n  src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dxj9qr5gj/image/upload/v1614174726/maggieappleton.com/notes/learnable-programming/learnprog_1_nsfflv.png\"\n  alt=\"repl.it slpit screen interface\"\n/\u003e\n\u003cimg\n  src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dxj9qr5gj/image/upload/v1614174727/maggieappleton.com/notes/learnable-programming/learnprog_4_dk82q8.png\"\n  alt=\"codesandbox split screen interface\"\n/\u003e\n\u003cimg\n  src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dxj9qr5gj/image/upload/v1614174727/maggieappleton.com/notes/learnable-programming/learnprog_5_tlycev.png\"\n  alt=\"free code camp split screen interface\"\n/\u003e\n\u003cimg\n  src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dxj9qr5gj/image/upload/v1614174726/maggieappleton.com/notes/learnable-programming/learnprog_3_bkslg8.png\"\n  alt=\"khan academy split screen interface\"\n/\u003e\n\n\u003c/TwoColumn\u003e\n\n\u003cspan\n  style={{ textAlign: \"center\", marginBottom: \"var(--space-m)\" }}\n  className=\"metadata\"\n\u003e\n  Interfaces from Repl.it, Codesandbox, freeCodeCamp, and Khan Academy\n\u003c/span\u003e\n\nThey're your standard column-based \"live coding\" interfaces popular across the industry. You write code into one section, and hopefully get the output you expected in another. Syntax is abstracted away from the elements it affects.\n\n\u003cSpacer size=\"small\" /\u003e\n\n### Programming into the Void\n\nIt's easy to see why these linear, text-based interfaces _seem_ like the best approach. They look identical to the standard interfaces the whole development industry uses to programme.\n\nWe write code into an isolated text editor. If you type the correct sequence of words and symbols into the editor, the correct series of events happens somewhere out of view.\n\nWe start this process in a context that looks something like this...\n\n\u003cMysteriousVoid /\u003e\n\n...and get the output in a separate browser window. God only know what happened in the middle.\n\nFunctions ran in an some unseen JavaScript engine, interface elements drew themselves onto the canvas, and somewhere a value changed in a distant database.\n\nWe're only shown the end result. To see anything happening in the middle, we have to `console.log` out data at each step of the way. Or dig into dense developer panels and debuggers. The industry has accepted flying blind as standard operating procedure.\n\n\u003cSpacer size=\"small\" /\u003e\n\n### Raising the Programming Bar\n\nWe're training people in the same kind of environment they'll be working in professionally. In the just-get-a-job-mindset that's an excellent approach. But Bret isn't talking about the ideal way to learn programming in the short-term, bootcampy world view. When he talks about these environments as inadequate, he's referencing a much larger paradigm shift around how we should design human-computer interfaces.\n\nHe's pointing out that the standard text-based, disembodied, non-graphical interfaces we all put up with are unintuitive to humans who live in a highly visual, spatial, embodied world. While most of our modern user interfaces have graduated to a graphical, 3D space-based system, programming is staunchly attached to the linear text paradigm.\n\nThere's good reason for this. While many people have tried to develop [visual programming languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_programming_language), they've largely failed to gain traction. There's lots of [well-reasoned](https://www.outsystems.com/blog/posts/visual-programming-language/) [arguments](https://dzone.com/articles/visual-programming-why-its-a-bad-idea) [explaining](https://mikehadlow.blogspot.com/2018/10/visual-programming-why-its-bad-idea.html) why it's so difficult to design visual systems complex and extensible enough to programme in, so I won't repeat them here.\nThe fact is that our current visual languages aren't sophisticated enough to do the job, and we're a long way from any system that could.\n\n\u003cSpacer size=\"small\" /\u003e\n\n### Visual Programming for Learning\n\nWhile visual programming isn't great for the scale of complexity professional programmers deal with, it's _ideal_ for people who are learning to code. When we simply need to explain what's happening under the hood, graphical representations are the best way to help people build clear mental models.\n\nComputer history legends like [Alan Kay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Kay) and [Seymour Paypert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seymour_Papert) were the earliest champions of using intuitive visuals to teach programming. Paypert developed a language called [Logo](\u003chttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_(programming_language)\u003e) in the late 1960's where you would type commands to direct a small green turtle around the screen, leaving a visible trail behind it. Through simple instructions like `go(20)` and `turn(90)` and `for i in range(12): go(20) turn(30)` you could draw elaborate graphic patterns. It became widely used in education and a whole generation began their programming lives in Logo.\n\n\u003cimg\n  width=\"500px\"\n  src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dxj9qr5gj/image/upload/v1622109247/maggieappleton.com/notes/learnable-programming/screenshot_eifk3w.png\"\n  alt=\"A classic example of a logo-based interface where you direct a small turtle around a canvas. Source: pythonturtle.org\"\n  showalt\n/\u003e\n\nMy own earliest memory of programming involved directing one of these small green amphibians around in circles. If you want a little throwback, you can play with a live Turtle environment at [Turtle Academy](https://turtleacademy.com/playground)\n\nThe modern manifestation of Logo is MIT's [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/) learning platform. It expanded the character range beyond just turtles, offering everything from llamas to dancing starfish. It also gives you the syntax as drag-n-drop blocks which visually distinguish variables from loops, logic operations, events, and motion commands.\n\n\u003cImageFrame\n  width=\"1000px\"\n  src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dxj9qr5gj/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto,q_auto:best,w_1400/v1622107452/maggieappleton.com/notes/learnable-programming/scratch_aqp3ts.png\"\n  alt=\"The scratch learning platform that allows you to construct clear visual chains of programming commands\"\n  showalt\n/\u003e\n\nIf we look past the campy, child-friendly aesthetics of Scratch, it's hard to argue this kind of visual interface isn't helpful. There is no need to memorise the syntax, it's easy to browse through the available commands, and the physical shape and color of each command limits makes clear where you can and can't put it. Hovering over operations shows you whether they're true or false and variables reveal their current value.\n\n\u003cBasicImage\n  imageWidth=\"1000px\"\n  src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dxj9qr5gj/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto,q_auto:best,w_1400/v1624617679/maggieappleton.com/notes/learnable-programming/scratch_symbols_shrink_gkiw5q.png\"\n  alt=\"A selection of the avaliable programming commands in Scratch\"\n  showalt\n/\u003e\n\nI could wax lyrical about the genius of this approach for paragraphs but I'll spare you.

These are pimped out code editors that offer programmers a buffet a helpful tools like debuggers, git logs, and advanced search functionality. VSCode, WebStorm, and XCode are all popular IDEs\u003c/Footnote\u003e get us close to this, but offer just enough freedom to still hang ourselves sometimes. You also need to know IDEs exist in the first place, and _then_ learn how to setup and effectively use one; a heady challenge in itself. Many beginners flail around in blank, unresponsive code files with no autocompletion, syntax snippets, or linters to assist them until someone lets them in on the industry secret (speaking from personal experience here).\n\n---\n\n## Principles of Learnable Programming\n\nLet's circle back to Bret Victor and his concept of _learnable programming_. Bret outlined a set of principles he believed all programming environments should follow if they want their learners to make any headway. He argues a good environment should allow learners to:\n\n1. **Read the vocabulary** of a language by making clear what each keyword and function does\n2. **Follow the flow** of what happens at each stage in executing a programme\n3. **See the state** as the programme changes variables over time\n4. **Create by reacting** to how the programme behaves\n5. **Create by abstracting** from the simple to the complex\n\nMost of these are explicitly **visual**. We need to make what's happening in the programme _readable_ through visual representations of each syntax element, variable, and change of state over time. As Bret puts it:\n\n\u003e \"People understand what they can see. If a programmer cannot see what a program is doing, she can't understand it.\"\n\nI won't expand on these too much as Bret elaborates on them in the [original piece](http://worrydream.com/#!/LearnableProgramming) and provides plenty of tangible examples of how they might look in an interface. These principles amount to a kind of [[Pattern Language]] - they're a set of design rules that loosely define how a system should work, rather than a strict specification or implementation.\n\nSince Bret wrote his piece in 2012, it's recieved plenty of buzz and cultish admiration (deservedly, IMHO). But I haven't seen it fully applied in any live learning platforms.\n\nThe world of programming education has certainly stepped up its visual game over the last decade. It's no longer just two column, text-based execution contexts. We're now swimming in interactive visual environments and gamified educational platforms.\n\nI began researching the field to see how many of them were putting Bret's principles into practice. The examples I looked at ranged from full-on illustrated games to lightly animated sequences of text. As I explored, I started to notice design patterns beyond the principles Bret outlined.\n\nWhile Bret defined a set of ideals for a hypothetical learning platform, I became more interested in finding patterns in what already exists. While we're a long way from achieving the '_ideal_' system, there's plenty of good design happening here and now.\n","data":{"title":"Making Programming Visual, Spatial, and Learnable","description":"What's wrong with linear, static programming mediums and how might we improve them?","startDate":"2021-01-12","updated":"2021-09-13","type":"note","topics":["Web Development","JavaScript","Collaborative Learning"],"growthStage":"budding"},"slug":"learnable-programming","filePath":"learnable-programming.mdx"},{"content":"\n\u003cIntroParagraph\u003e\n\nThere are some of us who believe digital life should be lived through a series of keyboard shortcuts.

The mineral water is natural. The unrefined cane sugar is natural. The low-fat Greek style yogurt is natural. The gluten-free buckwheat toasted muesli is natural. The anti-oxidising cranberry, chocolate, and coconut vegan protein bars are natural.\n\n\u003c/IntroParagraph\u003e\n\n\"Natural\" has become both a ubiquitous and meaningless label on food packaging. This observation is nothing profound. Hundreds of op-ed authors have lamented the lack of governmental regulation stopping producers from putting \"natural,\" \"free-range,\" \"wholegrain,\" \"authentic,\" \"superfood,\" and \"organic\" on their shiny cereal box of sugar puffs. We have all become comfortably jaded with the empty, hyperbolic language of our food. At least enough to not take it seriously.\n\nBut this is not a diatribe about food packaging. The bone I'm picking is not with the label on my chicken, but the chicken's supposed origin – **nature.**\n\nAt its core, nature defines the world without humans in it. It is everything that the birds, bacteria, forests, fish, and ocean currents do without our input. We consider it distinct and opposed to the expansion pack that humans brought to life; culture. We think of culture as everything humans layer on top of the natural world; the icing on the cosmic cake.\n\nAt least, this is one version of the mythological story; the one most of us accept as historical fact. Hominids sprang up in South Africa 80,000 years ago and began carving wooden digging sticks, smearing red ochre on one another, and threading long necklaces made from shards of ostrich eggs. While they were busy decorating, the cosmic fabric split and created a division. The world before the humans, and the world after. At least this is the story we, the humans, tell ourselves.\n\n\u003cComingSoon /\u003e\n","data":{"title":"Natureculture, Moral Purity, and Cultural Boundaries","description":"Why there is nothing natural about the idea of 'nature'","aliases":["Nature","nature and culture"],"startDate":"2021-05-18","updated":"2021-07-29","type":"note","topics":["Anthropology","Cultured Meat"],"growthStage":"seedling"},"slug":"natureculture","filePath":"natureculture.mdx"},{"content":"\n\u003cimg\n  width=\"650px\"\n  alt=\"A green plant being edited by a pencil\"\n  src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dg3gyk0gu/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto,q_auto:good,w_750/v1590361285/maggieappleton.com/notes/garden-history/garden-sm-2.png\"\n/\u003e\n\n\u003cAssumedAudience\u003e\n  Active users of Roam Research interested in learning new techniques and\n  workflows that will help them connect and organise their ideas\n\u003c/AssumedAudience\u003e\n\n\u003cIntroParagraph\u003e\n\nJust like a good seventeenth century English garden, this [[Digital Garden]] has two sides to it – the private and the public.

Otherwise the rest of this post will be completely bewildering.\u003c/Footnote\u003e\n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\nWhile many digital gardeners choose to make their entire notes database public, I'm\na bit more reserved. The notes and thoughts I post here are closer to in-progress,\ninformal essays. Lightly edited collections of ideas instead of the raw words that\ncome to me as I parse through books, papers, podcasts, and subconscious thoughts.\n\n\u003c/IntroParagraph\u003e\n\nRoam is where my unfiltered and unshaped thinking happens. It acts a place I can externalise my thoughts to see what I think, clarify those thoughts, and connect them together.\n\nThere are many names for systems like this; [second brains](/basb), [tools for thought](https://numinous.productions/ttft/), or [personal knowledge management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_knowledge_management) practices. Perhaps \"intentional notetaking\" sufficiently captures it.\n\nMy approach is heavily influenced by the [Zettelkasten](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/overview/) system; a method that focuses on constructing a web of declarative, connected notes that act as building blocks for creative output. \u003cFootnote idName={2}\u003eIf you are new to the idea of Zettelkasten, I strongly recommend you read the [introductory material](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/overview/). Understanding this approach to knowledge work is far more profound and transformative than any app will ever be.\u003c/Footnote\u003e\nSonke Ahren's [How to Take Smart Notes](https://takesmartnotes.com/) book, as well as [Andy Matuschak](https://andymatuschak.org/)'s [Evergreen Notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Evergreen_notes) approach are both great introductions to the Zettelkasten ethos. I'm particularly taken with Andy's intepretation of it, and illustrated a summary of the _evergreen notes_ system in [[Growing the Evergreens]].\n\nThis TLDR is you focus on writing **atomic**, **declarative** notes in **your own words**. The titles of these \"_Evergreen_\" or \"_Zettel_\" notes are statements; things you believe based on what you've read and experienced in the world. Things like \"**Naming is the hardest part of programming**\", or \"**Fitness culture has replaced religion in modern society**\". You follow this up with a paragraph or two explaining the statement and any literary references that led you to that belief.\n\n\u003cimg\n  width=\"950px\"\n  src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dxj9qr5gj/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto,q_auto:best,w_1000/v1626013083/maggieappleton.com/notes/evergreen-notes/Evergreen_Notes_03_cyjnrl_shrink_urtoqe.png\"\n  alt=\"Illustration of evergreen notes emerging from fleeting notes you take from books, conversations, articles, or podcasts\"\n/\u003e\n\nYou then combine these Evergreen notes into sequences. Each note can belong to multiple lines of thought. Connecting them together easily allows you to create outlines for articles, papers, or other forms of knowledge work. By using this core collection of beliefs as a starting point to build arguments and logical conclusions, you're never faced with a blank page. Realisations emerge from the bottom up.\n\n\u003cimg\n  width=\"750px\"\n  src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dxj9qr5gj/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto,q_auto:best,w_900/v1626012057/maggieappleton.com/notes/roam-garden/evergreens-flex_fdqpvv.jpg\"\n  alt=\"Diagram of a collection of evergreen notes flexibly combining to form outlines\"\n/\u003e\n\n#### Evergreens / Zettelkasten and Roam Research\n\nThere's plenty of hype and chatter about Zettelkasten systems in the Roam community. However, I haven't seen many walkthroughs of well-developed databases filled with Zettels. Two notable exceptions to this are [Joel Chan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6PIrVZoZAk) and [Beau Haan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoddCmn3eL0), both of whom have very thoughtfully mapped the qualities of a Zettelkasten into a Roam system.\n\nMost other tutorials lack practical examples outside the realm of productivity and note-taking. They fail to show what a collection of real Zettels looks like, how they emerge from research, and how they connect together to lead to meaningful output.\n\nI'm sharing my system here to put one more tangible example out into the world. I've been working with Zettels in Roam for over a year and have 150+ of them written \u003cFootnote idName={4}\u003eWhich is still a meagre beginners pile compared to the [90,000](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/zettelkasten-hubs/) Niklas Luhmann wrote over the course of his career. #ZettelGoals\u003c/Footnote\u003e. They have helped me clarify my beliefs, synthesise my understanding of other people's work, see connections across many different texts, spot holes in my arguments, and guided my research. They feed into my digital garden notes, essays, and conference talks. While I am certainly not a decorated academic or prominent researcher, they serve my plebian needs as an everyday knowledge worker.\n\nMy system is not an ideal or universal template. It certainly has flaws I'm oblivious to and will learn over time. \u003cFootnote idName={3}\u003eIf you notice potential flaws, I would love to hear your thoughts **only if** you've been working in a Zettelkasten for 6+ months and creating public-facing work with it.\u003c/Footnote\u003e It may not fit what you want and need from a system. But taken with a grain of salt, this post may give you ideas for your own Roam-based Zettelkasten.\n\n\u003cSpacer /\u003e\n\n## A tour through the Evergreens\n\nThe easiest way to show you this system is to walk you through it. I've recorded a quick video tour here, but you can also find the written version below.\n\n\u003cVideo\n  src=\"https://www.loom.com/embed/8a17c7277f0442b8963e72a0475171a8\"\n  title=\"A tour through the evergreens\"\n/\u003e\n\n\u003cSpacer /\u003e\n\n### Anatomy of an Evergreen Note\n\nZettels in my system are called **Evergreens**. Evergreens each have their own page. Their titles begin with the ✱ symbol and make a declarative statement – a single sentence that captures the main thesis.\n\nThe ✱ symbol \u003cFootnote idName={5}\u003eI paste this in with a keyboard shortcut. You can set this up with any text expander app like \u003ca href=\"https://textexpander.com/\"\u003eTextExpander\u003c/a\u003e or \u003ca href=\"https://www.alfredapp.com/\"\u003eAlfred\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/Footnote\u003e allows me to quickly search my database for Evergreens using the navigation bar and immediately have my results filtered for only Evergreens\n\n\u003cBasicImage\n  width=\"700px\"\n  src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dxj9qr5gj/image/upload/v1625430358/maggieappleton.com/notes/roam-garden/search_shrink_z8uiar.png\"\n  alt=\"A dropdown menu showing a preview list of my evergreen notes\"\n/\u003e\n\nThe primary links to these notes are all kept on a single page called (appropriately) _Evergreens_. They're roughly grouped into large themes that my work centres around; design, embodied cognition, visual explanations, cultural anthropology, technology, economics, education, etc.\n\n\u003cImageFrame\n  width=\"900px\"\n  src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dxj9qr5gj/image/upload/v1625407664/maggieappleton.com/notes/roam-garden/evergreens-page_ply6mc.png\"\n  alt=\"Screencapture of my evergreen notes page showing a selection of the notes\"\n/\u003e\n\nThe order of the notes isn't critically important, but I generally try to arrange them as threads of an ongoing conversation. Each new Evergreen note continues or builds off a train of thought already emerging on the page.\n\nThe numbers to the right of each Evergreen are block references – they counts the number of times I've connected that Evergreen note to another one. I'll expand on how that works a bit later on.\n\nInside each of these Evergreens, I add the _\"Evergreens\"_ tag as a top-level reference. This makes it possible to search Evergreens with queries elsewhere in my database. Under that I expand on the main thesis in 2-3 paragraphs. I then have sections for _Literature Notes_, _Fleeting Notes_, related tags, and _Branches_.\n\nHere's two examples of what a fully fleshed Evergreen looks like in my system:\n\n\u003cImageFrame\n  src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dxj9qr5gj/image/upload/v1625406589/maggieappleton.com/notes/roam-garden/evergreen-expanded_ortnoy.png\"\n  alt=\"Screenshot of an evergreen note about infrastructures in Roam that includes a title, body, literature notes, fleeting notes, related tags, and branching notes\"\n/\u003e\n\n\u003cImageFrame\n  src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dxj9qr5gj/image/upload/v1625428508/maggieappleton.com/notes/roam-garden/evergreen-exp-2_shrink_jdfbjq.png\"\n  alt=\"Screenshot of an evergreen note about cultural abnormality in Roam that includes a title, body, literature notes, fleeting notes, related tags, and branching notes\"\n/\u003e\n\nSeeing these hopefully gives you a more tangible understanding of what Evergreens look like. Let's break down each section in more detail:\n\n**Literature notes** link to any books or articles that led me to this belief or realisation. I keep book notes on their own page while articles, podcasts, and video lecture notes live on daily notes pages. I add either the page reference or the block reference to each literature item, then nest block references to specific relevant notes under it. This allows me to see where I first stumbled upon the idea, and open up a full set of notes on the text if I want to find connected ideas. This is usually where Evergreens begin; I come across an idea in something I'm reading or researching that resonates.\n\n**Fleeting notes** are where I put my loose and scattered thoughts on the topic. They're the scratch pad area where I try to figure out what the Evergreen is about, phrase the idea in different ways, and add examples of where I see the principle applied in real life. These are written alongside literature notes; they're my immediate reactions to the idea that help me figure out why I find it interesting, expand on it, and phrase it in my own words.\n\nThe **Related to** section is where I add any topic tags. This is useful for querying your notes later on. For example if I want to find evergreens related to _Infrasturcture_ or _Gender Norms_ while I'm writing an essay later on, I can construct a query for '_Evergreens_' + '_Gender Norms_' and find what I need.\n\n**Branches** are what connect different Evergreen notes together. These are block references from the main _Evergreens_ page. To create these, I find Evergreen notes that are related to the note I'm currently creating. I then copy the **block reference** that holds the Evergreen on the main page, and paste it under _Branches_.\n\n\u003cImageFrame\n  width=\"1300px\"\n  src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dxj9qr5gj/image/upload/v1625433040/maggieappleton.com/notes/roam-garden/blockref-2_shrink_ke5fgr.png\"\n  alt=\"Diagram showing a note on the main evergreens page being block referenced under the branches tab of an evergreen note\"\n/\u003e\n\nThis might seem odd to do. Why create a block reference instead of just putting a link to the Evergreen page in?\n\nThis trick creates a _different type of link_ to a page reference. It makes it easier to see chains of related Evergreens. If we now go to our Evergreens page and click on the number next to each Evergreen note, it opens up a condensed view of all the notes I think are related to this one:\n\n\u003cImageFrame\n  width=\"850px\"\n  src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dxj9qr5gj/image/upload/v1625434315/maggieappleton.com/notes/roam-garden/branches-2_clqmx4.png\"\n  alt=\"Screencapture showing the block references under an Evergreen expanded to reveal all the related notes\"\n/\u003e\n\nArranging Evergreens in this format allows us to build multiple chains of conversation between notes, and quickly reference them when we're trying to outline own our essays, talks, or original creations.\n\n---\n\n## Working in a Constantly Evolving System\n\nI started writing this post back in March of 2020 after I did a tour of my Roam database with [Rob Haisfield](https://robhaisfield.com/about). Rob has been hosting a [series on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWA6aNcUjK2w0Z_-0UURq_g/videos) where Roamers walk through their databases showing all the ways they've adapted the system to their particular needs. \u003cFootnote idName={6}\u003eThese are essentially a COVID-friendly version of \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/TheAnnaGat/status/1264172874304290816\"\u003eMTV Cribs\u003c/a\u003e for personal knowledge management nerds.

My philosophies haven't changed, only my implementation methods.\n\nI mention in the video that I expect my Roam system to evolve over time. I still think that's true.\n\nThanks to the thriving \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/roamcult\"\u003e#roamcult\u003c/a\u003e community, building and tending my Roam space has become a glorious exercise in knowledge management, experimental workflows, and collective problem solving.\n\nThere is no _one way_ to use Roam. Seeing the wide diversity of systems Roamers build is the whole point. It's a grand communal experiment.\n\n---\n\n## Page Prefixes\n\nI have a handful of page prefixes that help me distinguish between page types. I use Roam's [namespaces](https://roamstack.com/kb/basics/working-with-namespaces/) feature for these which allows me to prefix pages with full words, but collapse these into shorter letters:\n\n- Books/\n- Courses/\n- Projects/\n- ✱ for Evergreen notes\n- ⍜ for research questions\n- ⌆ for speculative outlines of original creations\n- ➽ for original creations themselves – drafts that are/will be public at some point. Essays, \u003ca href=\"/garden\"\u003edigital garden notes\u003c/a\u003e, conference talks, video tutorials, and livestream/podcast outlines all fall under this umbrella\n\nThese are handy for quickly searching for a certain type of note - the prefix lets you quickly scan through all your books/projects/Evergreen from just the inline search system\n\n\u003cp\u003e\n  It also means you can create multiple pages with the same title, but of\n  different types.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\n  For example, \u003cb\u003eBook/ Meat Planet\u003c/b\u003e and \u003cb\u003e➽ Meat Planet\u003c/b\u003e are two\n  different pages in my database. One is my notes on the book{\" \"}\n  \u003ca href=\"https://www.ucpress.edu/book/9780520295537/meat-planet\"\u003e\n    Meat Planet\n  \u003c/a\u003e\n  , and the second is a planning and draft-writing space for an \u003ca href=\"/meat-planet\"\u003e\n    illustrated essay I made\n  \u003c/a\u003e that took what I learned from the book and expanded it into an original creation.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n---\n\n## Keyboard Maestro\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.keyboardmaestro.com/main/\"\u003eKeyboard Maestro\u003c/a\u003e is the salt to my digital kitchen.

Capturing Links\n\nWhenever I find an article, academic paper, podcast, or video I want to save, I'm able to hit a specific hotkey that snaps up the page title and URL, then formats it into Roam-friendly markdown link.\n\n\u003cImageFrame\n  width=\"900px\"\n  src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dg3gyk0gu/image/upload/v1590959288/maggieappleton.com/notes/roam-garden/linkcapture.gif\"\n/\u003e\n\nI also have it set to auto-magically add specific tags to the end based on the type of link. So **Ctrl + A** tags it with **#Article**, and **Ctrl + V** tags it with **#Video**, etc.\n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n### 2. Auto-Opening Windows\n\nI have two hotkeys setup that make opening Roam frictionless.

Templating\n\nTo help keep my data base consistent, I have a set of pre-written templates I can pop into different kinds of pages - daily notes, books, projects, evergreen notes, etc.\n\nThese add sets of metadata into the front that make it easy for me to query pages later on.\n\n\u003cImageFrame\n  width=\"900px\"\n  src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dg3gyk0gu/image/upload/v1590959251/maggieappleton.com/notes/roam-garden/templates.gif\"\n/\u003e\n\nYou can use any snippet-expander app for this, such as Alfred, or TextExpander.

Not a linear pipeline.\n\nInstead of reading a whole book. _Then_ importing the notes. _Then_ highlighting and reflecting on them. _Then_ crafting a summary. _Then_ uploading the \"finished work\" to the internet, I instead do all of those at once. **In very small chunks.**\n\n\u003cp\u003e\n  Let's take a book I'm currently reading,{\" \"}\n  \u003ca href=\"/making-anthropology\"\u003eMaking by Tim Ingold\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr /\u003e My stream of\n  notes on it currently lives in three places simultaneously.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\nFirst, \u003ca href=\"https://getdrafts.com/\"\u003eDrafts\u003c/a\u003e app is where I capture book notes when I'm away from my desk (Roam's quick capture feature isn't its strong suit).\n\n\u003cimg src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dg3gyk0gu/image/upload/v1590778121/maggieappleton.com/notes/roam-garden/bookflow_1.png\" /\u003e\n\nIt's nice and simple, and always perfectly syncs between my iOS devices and the desktop app.\n\nI read on my phone (because I'm an awful person).

I still copy and paste key quotes, but I try to rephrase and rewrite ideas in my own terms as much as possible. Doing this just makes synthesising much easier and faster. It also helps me think.

It's also a fitting metaphor for one of the clubs I run at [Hyperlink Academy](https://hyperlink.academy/)\n\nThe [_Echo \u0026 Narcissus Writing Club_](https://hyperlink.academy/courses/echo-and-narcissus-writing-club/118) is all about mimicking the work of exceptional writers in order to learn from them.\n\nThis might sound scandalous depending on your understanding of creativity. I'm personally a subscriber to the [everything is a remix](https://vimeo.com/14912890) and [great artists steal](https://austinkleon.com/steal/) schools of thought.\n\nI used to think copying was unseemly before one of my writing professors in college filled me in on the big, unkept secret. He handed us a small trove of writing samples from folks like [Joan Didion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_Didion), [John McPhee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McPhee), [Barbara Kingsolver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbara_Kingsolver), and [Ernest Hemingway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_Hemingway). Essentially a Who's Who of New Yorker essayists. We had to copy out their work, then write our own pieces using the copied sentences as 'templates.'\n\nYou would take a Didion sentence like '_Only the very young and the very old may recount their dreams at breakfast, dwell upon self, interrupt with memories of beach picnics and favorite Liberty lawn dresses and the rainbow trout in a creek near Colorado Springs_,' and learn how to see it as \"Only the **\\_\\_\\_\\_** and the **\\_\\_\\_\\_** may **\\_\\_\\_\\_**, **\\_\\_\\_\\_**, **\\_\\_\\_\\_** and **\\_\\_\\_\\_**.\" A reusable format for pointing out similarities between two distinct things.\n\nThe point is not to rip off Didion, but to begin to see how she uses nouns. Where she places verbs. How she handles semi-colons. Where she begins a story and where she ends it. How she asks a question. How she makes you doubt her credibility as a narrator.\n\nCopying forces you to look at writing techniques under a microscope. You stop seeing your favourite authors as magical beings who pump out great work from behind a veil. Everything you need to know about their process and how to write like them is already on the page in front of you.\n\nGreat writers become great by closely studying and copying other great writers.\nThis is how cultural knowledge works. We learn the foundational skills from each other first, and then get all weird and experimental later on once the normal rules become boring.\n\n\u003cSpacer size=\"small\" /\u003e\n\n## Who This is For and What to Expect\n\nIf you have a writing practice of any kind, and feel the urge to improve it, this club is for you. You will need to bring along a Narcissus - a writer whose work you love and want to emulate. If you are bad at making choices, you can bring along two.\n\nWe keep it casual - the weekly meetings are to chat, compare what we've learned, and give each other feedback in pairs. There won't be lectures or lots of instruction. As a peer learning group, it's simply a way to gather together and support each other on our journey to being less-crap-writers.\n\nIt will require a commitment to write. The writing doesn't have to be good or profound or SEO-optimised. It simply needs to try and copy the style of your Narcissus.\nWe'll write 500 word pieces for the first 4 weeks, and 1000+ words in the final week.\n\nIt runs for **6 weeks** and **costs 35 USD**. I find a little skin in the game helps everyone show up on time. Committed folks make the experience better for everyone.\n\n---\n\n## Cohort 1\n\nThe first cohort of this club ran from **May 1st** to **June 6th 2021**.\n\nWe ended up with a wonderfully committed and insightful group of folks – something you don't always bank on with online learning groups.\n\nEveryone came in with an active writing practice which I think made a significant difference. They already made time to write; publishing to personal blogs, newsletters, or ongoing fiction collections. The club simply directed that writing effort toward certain themes and assignments.\n\n\u003cSpacer size=\"small\" /\u003e\n\n#### Our Echos and Narcissus Pairs\n\n[Daniel Miller](https://twitter.com/danielindustri4) echoed William Gibson  \n[Jan Sondermann](https://twitter.com/jsoendermann) echoed Steven Pinker  \n[Abe Kim](https://twitter.com/ich_bin_abe) echoed Colin Barrett  \n[Catherine Woodiwiss](https://twitter.com/chwoodiwiss) echoed George Saunders  \n[Dave Bernhard](https://twitter.com/daveforall) echoed Terry Pratchett  \n[Keni](https://adagia.org/writer/13) echoed Scott Adams / Trevor Noah  \n[Jonathan Yeong](https://twitter.com/JonoYeong) echoed Brandon Sanderson / Ed Yong  \n[Shime](https://shime.sh/) and [Andrew Nalband](https://twitter.com/nalband) both echoed Paul Graham  \nAnd I echoed Ursula K.

Lots of these were beginnings or experiments – a first pass at an idea, the start of a chapter, a lead in to a longer piece of research. Here's a selection of them:\n- [The Ancestral Hall of Side Projects](https://www.jonathanyeong.com/garden/the-ancestral-hall-of-side-projects) by Jonathan Yeong\n- [Coming to America - Robbed](https://adagia.org/content/1668) by Keni --\u003e\n\n\u003cSpacer size=\"small\" /\u003e\n\n#### Club Logistics\n\nI wanted to run the club in a space where we could take open-ended notes, write individual essays, and leave comments on each other's work. I ended up using [Notion](https://notion.so) which worked great – it became the organising spot for agendas, weekly assignments, resources, and casual chatter:\n\n\u003cImageFrame\n  width=\"1000px\"\n  src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dxj9qr5gj/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto,q_auto:best,w_1200/v1623137511/maggieappleton.com/notes/echo-narcissus/The_Echo_Narcissus_Writing_Club_shrink_yfymsh.png\"\n  alt=\"Screencapture of our Notion space listing weekly themes and links to other pages\"\n/\u003e\n\nWe all posted our weekly writing to a central database in here. I then used Notion's fancy [linked databases and filtering](https://www.notion.so/Linked-databases-fb007e2798d04c57aee839ecf6ce450a) features to have the right assignments show up in each week's agenda. This made it easy to see everyone compiling notes, analysing texts, and writing over the course of the week.\n\nHere's an example of what each weekly agenda looked like:\n\n\u003cImageFrame\n  width=\"1000px\"\n  src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dxj9qr5gj/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto,q_auto:best,w_1200/v1623138078/maggieappleton.com/notes/echo-narcissus/Week_4_-_Descriptions_and_Details_shrink_drzycw.png\"\n  alt=\"The agenda, writing pieces, and homework assignment for week 4 of the club\"\n/\u003e\n\nNotion worked great for this round.

Illustrated notes\n\nAnything I make that has a painterly and loose hand-drawn feel was made in Procreate on the iPad or Photoshop on the Wacom Cintiq. Or probably a combination – it's easy to move files back and forth between the two and the tools they offer are very similar.\n\nIllustrations like these...\n\n\u003cTwoColumn\u003e\n\n\u003cBasicImage src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dxj9qr5gj/image/upload/v1621767637/maggieappleton.com/notes/tools/Photo_by_Maggie_Appleton_on_June_30_2019._htaur3.jpg\" /\u003e\n\n\u003cBasicImage src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dxj9qr5gj/image/upload/v1621767975/maggieappleton.com/notes/tools/Unfathomable_Meat_wp_wge87m.png\" /\u003e\n\n\u003c/TwoColumn\u003e\n\n\u003cBasicImage\n  width=\"1100px\"\n  src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dxj9qr5gj/image/upload/v1621767505/maggieappleton.com/notes/tools/GitMistakes--large_shrink_qm96ik.png\"\n/\u003e\n\nBoth of these applications allow you to draw in \"raster\" graphics, meaning you paint pixels onto a canvas. They require a decent level of hand-skills to make sure your lines aren't wobbly, although both applications have smoothing features to help with that.\n\nWhen I'm in Procreate I use a small selection of brushes I've gathered over the years. It's hard for me to remember where they're all from, and I've customised the majority of them to suit my personal prefs. Most of them were originally from Max Ulichney's [MaxPacks](https://maxpacks.com/) brushes. I have the essentials set ($2), the painters set ($8), and the comics set ($15), and can vouch they're all great.\n\n\u003cImageFrame\n  width=\"1100px\"\n  src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dxj9qr5gj/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto,q_auto:good,w_1200/v1621764330/maggieappleton.com/notes/tools/IMG_74BF7CB1E720-1_xpci1a.jpg\"\n  alt=\"A screenshot of my iPad with Procreate open and my brushes panel displayed\"\n/\u003e\n\nI move these pieces to Photoshop if I want to work on a larger screen, or have accidentally enlarged the canvas to a 14000px wide sprawling set of sketches that Procreate can't open without crashing.\n\n\u003cImageFrame\n  width=\"1100px\"\n  src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dxj9qr5gj/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto,q_auto:good,w_1200/v1621764627/maggieappleton.com/notes/tools/PhotoshopSnap_bduk6w.png\"\n  alt=\"A screenshot of my Photoshop setup\"\n/\u003e\n\n### 2.

They are all centred around writing text documents that flow from left-to-right, then top-to-bottom; the way all text works in English. Even if they support other languages, you'd still write Arabic or Hebrew or Urdu linearly, just right-to-left.\n\n\u003c/IntroParagraph\u003e\n\nYou might say this is what defines a _note_; it is a chunk of written text, presented as a small piece of digital paper. It's pretending to be a real piece of paper, but without many of the features that make real paper useful. Like the ability make marks on it that are not simply words in a straight line.\n\n\u003cImageFrame\n  src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dxj9qr5gj/image/upload/v1621509754/maggieappleton.com/notes/linear-notes/linear-scrawl_shrink_juilyb.png\"\n  showalt\n  alt=\"How it might look if we could draw into our notes without being confined to linear text\"\n  width=\"900px\"\n/\u003e\n\nI find it odd that few apps put sincere effort into becoming more paper-like. Most are too busy trying to become more _hyper_, in the _hyper_-text sense. They pride themselves on their multi-device compatibility, cloud synchronicity, and API integration automations. None of them question the central organising medium of linear text.\n\nIn this linear text-based ideology, images are second-class citizens. Illustrations, diagrams, graphics, photographs, doodles, drawings, and icons are visitors here.\n\nYou're welcome to pop them \"inline\", like a pseudo-text element that inconveniently isn't subscribing to the rules. But you're going to have to make your images elsewhere. This is a note-taking app, not a drawing app (we have to wonder when those became two separate things). You'll have to draw somewhere else. Probably on another device. Which you'll have to buy separately. And yes, it will be prohibitively expensive. Unless you've found a way to draw by tapping out lines with your keyboard.\n\nIf you're lucky, your particular note-taking app might let you change the size of this image. Good luck trying to place two images next to each other though. Multi-column layouts and horizontal movement are beyond our current note-taking capacities.\n\nPhysical space is our third-class citizen. Your notes are only allowed to move to the right and down. You cannot move left, upwards, diagonally, in front, behind, or past Go.\n\n\u003cHackyFormatting /\u003e\n\nYou cannot freely drag things around and place them wherever you like. That would make it too much like the real world, where we can place one sticky note to the left of another, place both above a small notecard, arrange these next to a book with sticky notes inside it, and pile it all on top a ripped out page from a notebook covered in haphazard scribbles and doodles, half of them upside-down.\n\nOne wonders how we haven't hung ourselves with this amount of spatial freedom.\n\nSo, who is to blame for our linear, textual predicament?\n\nThe designers who invented the paper-based desktop metaphor that haunts all modern interface design?

There's a older version listed on the [Roam database](https://roamresearch.com/#/app/help/page/fJRcVITNY).\n\n### Custom Styling Tags and Page Links\n\nAnother neat trick I love with CSS and Roam is creating specific styles for different page title and tags. \u003cFootnote idName={3}\u003eShoutout to fellow Roam user \u003ca href=\"https://malcolmocean.com/\"\u003eMalcolm Ocean\u003c/a\u003e who lobbied for this as an official feature of the Roam interface. I found out how to do it digging around in their impressively \u003ca href=\"https://gist.github.com/malcolmocean/03d777a1c8f89be8c98e3d89d6821607\"\u003ecomprehensive CSS files\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/Footnote\u003e. I have a little workflow taxonomy going that covers different kinds of output and the stages they flow through\n\n\u003cBasicImage\n  width=\"880px\"\n  alt=\"A screencapture of my Roam database with various colored tags\"\n  src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dg3gyk0gu/image/upload/c_scale,w_1457/v1590193543/maggieappleton.com/notes/datatags.png\"\n/\u003e\n\nWe're able to do this because when we use the double bracket or add a # to create a page tag, Roam adds a new attribute to the HTML markup. If the page is made with a #, it adds a `data-tag` attribute. If it's made with double brackets Roam adds a `data-link-title` attribute\n\n```html\n\u003cspan data-tag=\"Ideas\" class=\"rm-page-ref rm-page-ref-tag\"\u003e\n  #Ideas What if I learned how to chuck wood like a Chuck Norris woodchuck\n  could?\n\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan data-link-title=\"Ideas\" class=\"rm-page-ref\"\u003e\n  [ [Ideas] ] What if I learned how to chuck wood like a Chuck Norris woodchuck\n  could?\n\u003c/span\u003e\n```\n\nWe can then target both of those attributes with a CSS selector that looks like this:\n\n```css\nspan.rm-page-ref[data-tag=\"Ideas\"],\nspan[data-link-title^=\"Tweet\"] .rm-page-ref {\n  color: #fcb815;\n  padding: 3px 4px;\n  font-weight: 700;\n  line-height: 1.4em;\n}\n```\n\nThe first selector, `span.rm-page-ref[data-tag=\"Ideas\"]` changes any # link, and the second `span[data-link-title^=\"Tweet\"] .rm-page-ref` selector changes any link made with [ [ brackets]]\n\nIt makes an enormous difference in your user experience to be able to quickly identify different block and note types through visual color association.\n\nIf you just want to grab the tag and page styles from my theme , scroll down to the bottom of my \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/theianjones/roam-research-themes/blob/master/leyendecker.css\"\u003eCSS theme file\u003c/a\u003e to find them.\n\n### Block Level Styling\n\nRoam also allows you to style whole blocks based on tags. \u003cFootnote idName={4}\u003e[Cato Minor](https://twitter.com/catominor3?lang=en) originally wrote a script for doing this in JavaScript, but now it's native to Roam's CSS.\u003c/Footnote\u003e In my database I use this heavily when taking book notes to visually distinguish between claims, responses, questions, and evidence.\n\nTo style an entire block, and all its child elements, we use:\n\n```css\n.roam-block-container[data-page-links*=\"Comment\"] {\n  // styles in here\n}\n```\n\nTo style only the child elements but not the parent, add `.rm-block-children` to the end use:\n\n```css\n.roam-block-container[data-page-links*=\"Comment\"] .rm-block-children {\n  // styles in here\n}\n```\n\nTo style just the block itself but none of the child elements, add `\u003e div.rm-block-main` on:\n\n```css\n.roam-block-container[data-page-links*=\"Comment\"] \u003e div.rm-block-main {\n  // styles in here\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Alternate Styling with Browser Plugins\n\nIf you don't want to use the native Roam CSS functionality, there's a way to apply custom CSS styles to any website using a browser plugin.\n\nThis is especially useful if you're part of a **multi-player** Roam where everyone has their own styling preferences. [Stylus](https://stylus-lang.com/) has extensions for both [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/stylus/) and [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne?hl=en) that allow you to write your own CSS styles in a browser.\n\n\u003cImageFrame\n  width=\"980px\"\n  alt=\"A screen capture of the stylus interface\"\n  src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dg3gyk0gu/image/upload/c_scale,w_980/v1590188865/maggieappleton.com/notes/stylus.png\"\n/\u003e\n\nThey also have \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/openstyles/stylus/wiki/Editor\"\u003egood documentation\u003c/a\u003e that will walk you through how to use it.\n\nIt's good to note that this is not a Roam-specific hack.

Specifically in relation to building [scrollytelling](https://medium.com/nightingale/from-storytelling-to-scrollytelling-a-short-introduction-and-beyond-fbda32066964) pieces.\n\nHaving control over where elements are positioned on a webpage is essential for building scrollytelling stories. We have to understand exactly how elements will behave within the layout, especially in relation to the scrollbar and viewport.\n\nThe `position` property determines where an element appears on the page. Sounds simple. But it also includes how an element relates to its parent element, the browser window, how it behaves on scroll, and whether placement properties like `top`, `right`, `bottom`, `left` and `z-index` will have any effect.\n\n## **Position** can have six possible values\n\n### 1. Static\n\n`static` is the default value for elements. They stick to the normal page flow and placement properties (top, left, z-index, etc.) don't have any effect.\n\n\u003cCenter\u003e\n\n\u003cStaticCSSPosition /\u003e\n\n\u003c/Center\u003e\n\n\u003cSpacer /\u003e\n\n### 2. Relative\n\n`relative` keeps the element in the normal document flow, but allows us to use placement properties. This means we can move the element up, down, left or right, relative to where it would have been in the normal document flow.\n\nFor example, if we nudge this box `-10px` up, and `-10px` to the left, it moves to here:\n\n\u003cCenter\u003e\n\n\u003cRelativeCSSPosition /\u003e\n\n\u003c/Center\u003e\n\n\u003cSpacer size=\"small\" /\u003e\n\nIn our CSS we would just need to declare a `relative` property on our box, then add `top` and `left` properties:\n\n```css\n.redBox {\n  position: relative;\n  top: -10px;\n  left: -10px;\n}\n```\n\n\u003cSpacer /\u003e\n\n### 3. Absolute\n\n`absolute` removes the element from the normal document flow. It places itself on an absolute position relative to the whole document.\n\nThe position of the parent has no influence on where the child shows up. Placement values like `top` and `left` are calculated relative to the document.\n\nDeclaring `position: absolute`, `left: 10px` and `bottom: 20px` on this `.redBox` element would position it 10 pixels from the left and 10px from the bottom of the document.\n\n\u003cCenter\u003e\n\n\u003cAbsoluteCSSPosition /\u003e\n\n\u003c/Center\u003e\n\n\u003cSpacer /\u003e\n\n#### **Relative Parents and Absolute children**\n\nIf you declare `position: relative` on the parent element, and `position: absolute` on the child, it now positions itself relative to the parent.\n\nThis is useful for creating overlapping elements.\n\n\u003cSpacer /\u003e\n\n### 4. Fixed\n\n`fixed` is similar to absolute, but sticks itself to the viewport rather than the document. Fixed elements don't move when you scroll down the page - they are always visible.\n\nFixed is useful for persistent elements like navigation bars or menus.\n\nDeclaring `position: fixed;`, `top: 10px;` and `right: 10px` on an element will position it 10 px from the top and right-hand side of the browser viewport. The rest of the document scrolls behind it.\n\n\u003cCenter\u003e\n\n\u003cFixedCSSPosition /\u003e\n\n\u003c/Center\u003e\n\n\u003cSpacer size=\"small\" /\u003e\n\n#### **Annoying Transform Quirk**\n\nIf any parent element has a `transform: translate()` property declared on it, `fixed` won't work.\n\n\u003cSpacer /\u003e\n\n### 5. Sticky\n\n`sticky` makes an element \"stick\" to the viewport when it reaches a certain point – usually when the top of the viewport hits the top of the element.\n\nIt behaves like a `relative` element until it hits the sticking point, and then becomes `fixed`.\n\nFor sticky to work, the parent element needs to have the `relative` property declared.\n\n\u003cSpacer /\u003e\n\n### 6. Inherit\n\n`inherit` forces an element to inherit the position property of its parent. This wouldn't otherwise happen as `position` doesn't flow down the cascade.\n\n\u003cReferences\u003e\n  \u003cReferencesLink\n    title=\"Position: CSS Tricks Almanac\"\n    href=\"https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/p/position/\"\n    author=\"Chris Coyier\"\n  /\u003e\n  \u003cReferencesLink\n    title=\"Advanced Positioning Tutorial\"\n    href=\"https://www.internetingishard.com/html-and-css/advanced-positioning/\"\n    author=\"Internetting is Hard\"\n  /\u003e\n  \u003cReferencesLink\n    title=\"Easier Scrollytelling with Position Sticky\"\n    href=\"https://pudding.cool/process/scrollytelling-sticky/\"\n    author=\"The Pudding\"\n  /\u003e\n\u003c/References\u003e\n","data":{"title":"Positioning Elements \u0026 Scrollytelling in CSS","description":"Notes on how to use the position property in CSS to make scrollytelling stories","updated":"2020-12-26","startDate":"2020-12-26","type":"note","topics":["The Web","CSS","Web Development"],"growthStage":"budding"},"slug":"css-position","filePath":"css-position.mdx"},{"content":"\n\u003cIntroParagraph\u003e\n\nThe idea of the **Cyborg** was born in 1960 in the thick of the US-Soviet Space Race, to two NASA consultants trying to solve the problem of keeping humans alive in the hostile conditions of outer space.\n\n\u003c/IntroParagraph\u003e\n\nNathan Kline and Manfred Clynes published a paper called '[Cyborgs and Space](http://www.guicolandia.net/files/expansao/Cyborgs_Space.pdf)' where they proposed that rather than trying to construct earth-like environments for humans to live in, we should try altering the humans themselves.\n\nThey imagined a _Cybernetic Organism_, or _Cyborg,_ that came with a built-in, self-regulating system that would take care of the bothersome issues of breathing, metabolism, sleep, circulation, and any other biological necessities, \"leaving man free to explore, to create, to think, and to feel.\"\n\nCreations often stray from their origins though.\n\nThe idea of the Cyborg has largely become a villainous character in science-fiction – used to explore the danger and discomfort we feel around our tools and systems. Let's just call this 'The Terminator Effect.'\n\nYet the idea has more philosophical promise and potential in it than Hollywood knows what to do with.\n\n---\n\nAnthropologist [Donna Haraway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donna_Haraway) is a pioneer of using the term _Cyborg_ as an imaginative toy in her 1991 essay [The Cyborg Manifesto](/cyborg-manifesto). In Haraway’s writing, the Cyborg becomes a way to explore our cultural assumptions around the dividing lines between \"nature\" and \"culture\".\n\nIt offers us a chance to question the strict categories and historical boundaries _Western Cosmology_ \u003cFootnote idName={1}\u003eI use the term _Western Cosmology_ as a slightly tounge-in-cheek way of referencing the \"_Western_\" belief system.\u003cbr /\u003eAlthough we should acknowledge \"_Western_\" isn't really a thing, but can be interpreted as some generic mashup of [WERID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology#WEIRD_bias), Euro-American, Judeo-Christian cultural ideals.\u003cbr /\u003eLanguage is flawed.

The firm divisions between humans / machines, natural / artificial, male / female, mind / body, fiction / reality, primitive / civilised, and science / society we are told most definitely exist. Despite the fact they are not in the least bit culturally universal.\n\nHaraway’s insight is not only well ahead of her time, but also remarkably accurate as society now struggles to deal with technological relationships that contradict and question those historical divisions. They are all inherently tied to the issue of understanding where the line between organism and machine gets drawn.

But when we want it to play nicely with a frontend framework like React, we run into some finicky issues.\n\n\u003c/IntroParagraph\u003e\n\nThis guide is specifically about using React Hooks with GreenSock, as many of the [existing guides](https://greensock.com/react/) only explain how to set it up with the old style of class components.\n\nThis isn't an introduction to the GreenSock library itself – head over to my post on [[The Bare Essentials of Greensock]] for that.\n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n## React, Meet GreenSock\n\nThe issue with combining these two libraries is that React acts as a DOM interloper – it sits between the code we write and the DOM, managing it for us.\n\nReact builds it's own internal \"tree\" of DOM nodes based off our code, and only updates the actual DOM as needed (a concept previously known as the [[React Virtual DOM]]) \u003cFootnote idName={1}\u003eThe React team has gone off the term of the _virtual DOM_ and prefer to talk about the _render tree_. Potatoes, potataos. For more on how the virtual DOM works, I have an [illustrated guide](/react-vdom)\u003c/Footnote\u003e\n\n\u003cBasicImage\n  alt=\"A diagram of React generating all the DOM nodes for us\"\n  src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dg3gyk0gu/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto,q_auto:best,w_1400/v1600973172/maggieappleton.com/notes/gsap/react-greensock-2.png\"\n/\u003e\n\nMeanwhile, the GreenSock library usually works by directly animating our DOM elements. Perhaps you can sense the tension in the room...\n\nSince the GreenSock library needs access to the DOM in order to animate it, we need to tell React about our Greensock animations. Otherwise the two end up in awkward arguments that can end in tears (primarily mine).\n\n## Bring in the React Hooks\n\nThere's two essential React hooks we'll use to connect our React code to our Greensock code: **useRef** and **useEffect**\n\n\u003cSimpleCard\u003e\n\n**useRef** lets us access and directly target our DOM nodes\n\n**useEffect** lets us to perform side effects – any functions or data requests that we want to run _after_ rendering the component to the DOM\n\n\u003c/SimpleCard\u003e\n\nIf you're not completely comfortable with [React Hooks](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/beginners-guide-to-using-react-hooks/) yet and those technical explanations mean nothing to you, don't worry we're going to slowly walk through this. With illustrations. Because who the fork properly understands _\"side effects\"_?\n\n---\n\n### Getting Setup\n\nWe first need to run `yarn install gsap` or `npm install gsap` into our React project repo \u003cFootnote idName={2}\u003e**gsap** is short for _GreenSock Animation Platform_ and it's the way we reference the Greensock library in all our code sytax\u003c/Footnote\u003e\n\n\u003cSimpleCard\u003e\n\nFeel free to open up a Codesandbox project to work through the steps while you read. I've set one up for you with React and Greensock already installed:\n\n\u003cButtonLink href=\"https://codesandbox.io/s/reacthooks-greensock-demo-xjoti?file=/src/AnimatedBox.js\"\u003e\n  Jump into CodeSandbox\n\u003c/ButtonLink\u003e\n\n\u003c/SimpleCard\u003e\n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n### Building our Animation Component\n\nLet's start by creating a React component called `\u003cAnimatedBox/\u003e` that is going to hold all our Greensock code. We're going to build a simple `\u003cdiv\u003e` element and have it animate across the page (exciting!).\n\nWe'll need to import the Greensock library into our component with `import { gsap }from 'gsap'`, as well as React and our two hooks with `import React, { useRef, useEffect } from 'react'`\n\n```js\nimport React, { useRef, useEffect } from \"react\";\nimport { gsap } from \"gsap\";\n\nconst Animation = () =\u003e {\n  return (\n    \u003cdiv\n      style={{\n        width: \"160px\",\n        height: \"160px\",\n        background: \"salmon\",\n      }}\n    /\u003e\n  );\n};\n```\n\nI've set some basic width, height, and color CSS styles on our div to make\nit visible on the page.\n\n\u003cp\u003e\n  \u003cdiv\n    style={{\n      margin: \"2em auto\",\n      width: \"120px\",\n      height: \"120px\",\n      background: \"salmon\",\n      borderRadius: \"4px\",\n    }}\n  /\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cCenter\u003e\n\nGood looking div, right? Salmon is always the right color choice.\n\n\u003c/Center\u003e\n\n---\n\n## Adding the useRef Hook\n\nWe're now going to add _references_ to our animation with the **useRef** hook.\n\nWe create a new reference by adding `const boxRef = useRef()` anywhere outside of our return statement. Call it anything you like, but _boxRef_ is a good enough name for this example.\n\nWe then add a `ref={boxRef}` attribute on our `\u003cdiv\u003e` element.\n\n```js\nconst Animation = () =\u003e {\n  const boxRef = useRef();\n\n  return (\n    \u003cdiv\n      ref={boxRef}\n      style={{\n        width: \"120px\",\n        height: \"120px\",\n        background: \"salmon\",\n      }}\n    /\u003e\n  );\n};\n```\n\nThis tells React we want to be able to control our `\u003cdiv\u003e` element with the `boxRef` reference once our component is mounted onto the DOM.\n\n---\n\n## Adding the useEffect Hook\n\nNext we're going to add our **useEffect** hook, and write our GreenSock animation inside of it.\n\nIf you're already familiar with greensock this will look fairly straightforward.\n\n```js\nconst Animation = () =\u003e {\n  const boxRef = useRef();\n\n  useEffect(() =\u003e {\n    gsap.to([boxRef.current], {\n      x: \"400px\",\n      duration: 2,\n    });\n  });\n\n  return (\n    \u003cdiv\n      ref={boxRef}\n      style={{\n        width: \"120px\",\n        height: \"120px\",\n        background: \"salmon\",\n      }}\n    /\u003e\n  );\n};\n```\n\nWe declare a normal `gsap.to()` tween, but instead of passing in an id or class name as the target element, we use `[boxRef.current]`.\n\nThis means we want gsap to animate the `.current` property of our `boxRef` reference – which is the `\u003cdiv\u003e` element we put that reference on.\n\n```js\ngsap.to([boxRef.current], {});\n```\n\nWe then pass in our variables object, which tells Greensock to move our div 400px along the _x_ axis over a duration of 2 seconds:\n\n```js\n{ x: 400px, duration: 2 }\n```\n\nAnd thus, our div animates...\n\n\u003cp\u003e\n\n\u003cTween\n  to={{\n    scrollTrigger: {\n      trigger: \"#boxRef\",\n      start: \"top 60%\",\n      end: \"+=500\",\n      scrub: true,\n    },\n    x: \"400%\",\n  }}\n  duration={2}\n  ease=\"back.out(1.3)\"\n\u003e\n  \u003cdiv\n    id=\"boxRef\"\n    style={{\n      margin: \"2em\",\n      width: \"120px\",\n      height: \"120px\",\n      background: \"salmon\",\n      borderRadius: \"4px\",\n    }}\n  /\u003e\n\u003c/Tween\u003e\n\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cCenter\u003e\n\n# Tada \u003cspan\u003e🎉\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003c/Center\u003e\n\nSo by this point, you hopefully have a working animation in that [Codesandbox project](https://codesandbox.io/s/reacthooks-greensock-demo-xjoti?file=/src/AnimatedBox.js) or a local repo.\n\n---\n\nIf you don't feel like mucking around with **useRef** and **useEffect**, [John Lindquist](https://johnlindquist.com/use-greensock-with-react-hooks/) created a simple React hook called **use-gsap** that hides them away.\n","data":{"title":"GreenSock Animations with React Hooks","description":"How to use the Greensock animation library inside React using React hooks","updated":"2020-09-27","startDate":"2020-09-27","type":"note","topics":["React","Scrollytelling","Design","JavaScript","Web Development","Greensock","Animation"],"growthStage":"budding"},"slug":"greensock-react","filePath":"greensock-react.mdx"},{"content":"\n_\"Drawing the Invisible: React Explained in Five Visual Metaphors\"_ is one of my conference talks about the importance of visual metaphors in explaining programming concepts.\n\nIt's perhaps also known as the **'React is a Potato'** talk.

A tween is a single transition – an element changing from state A to state B.\n\nTo create a tween, we target an _element_ (this can be any HTML element like a `\u003cdiv\u003e, \u003cp\u003e, or \u003csvg\u003e`) and pass in _variables_.\nVariables define how the element should change over the course of the animation - whether it should move, change opacity or color, grow big or small – you get it.\n\nLet's say we want to make a box go from navy blue to red, move 40% of the way across the screen \u003cFootnote id={1}\u003eI've used `40vw` units in this example which tells the browser to calculate 40% of the **view width**. `vw` is a handy unit for responsive design to make this work on little screens as well as big\u003c/Footnote\u003e on the X axis (horizontal), and grow in scale by 1.4 times the original:\n\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cCenter\u003e\n\n\u003cTweenRedBigBox /\u003e\n\n\u003c/Center\u003e\n\nHere's the code to do that in Greensock:\n\n```js\n\u003cdiv class=\"giantRedBox\" background=\"navyblue\" width=\"100px\" height=\"100px\" /\u003e;\n\ngsap.to(\".giantRedBox\", 2, { x: 40vw, scale: 1.4, background: \"red\" });\n```\n\n\u003cp\u003e\n\nFirst we target the element using it's classname: `giantRedBox`.  \nWe then pass in a _duration_ that defines how long it should take the animation to move from state A to state B – here it's 2 seconds.  \nFinally we pass in an object that contains our animation _variables_:  \n`{ x: 40vw, scale: 1.4, background: 'red' }`\n\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n---\n\n### Types of Tweens\n\nThere's three types of tweens:\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eto\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003efrom\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003efromTo\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\nIn _to_ we define the final state of the animation – what it looks like by the end.\nIt begins in the position defined in our HTML \u0026 CSS, and moves _to_ the state we define inside our greensock tween.\n\n```js\n\u003cdiv class=\"spinningBox\" background=\"navyblue\" width=\"100px\" height=\"100px\" /\u003e;\n\ngsap.to(\".spinningBox\", 3, { x: 40vw, rotation: 360 });\n```\n\n\u003cCenter\u003e\n\n\u003cTweenSpinningBox /\u003e\n\n\u003c/Center\u003e\n\n\u003cSpacer /\u003e\n\nIn _from_ we define the beginning state of the animation, and it moves back to it's state defined in the HTML \u0026 CSS\n\n```js\ngsap.from(\".reverseSpinningBox\", 3, { x: 40vw, rotation: 360 });\n```\n\n\u003cCenter\u003e\n\n\u003cTweenReverseSpinningBox /\u003e\n\n\u003c/Center\u003e\n\n\u003cSpacer /\u003e\n\nIn _fromTo_ we declare two states we want the animation to move between.\n\n```js\ngsap.fromTo(\".hotBox\", 3, { background: \"#93D0D9\" }, { background: \"#D93654\" });\n```\n\n\u003cCenter\u003e\n\n\u003cTweenBlueRedBox /\u003e\n\n\u003c/Center\u003e\n\n---\n\n### Timelines\n\nTimelines are made up of tweens.\nThey group them together into a sequence.\n\nOnce we declare a timeline, we can chain sets of tweens onto it.\n\n```js\nconst boxTimeline = gsap.timeline();\n\nboxTimeline\n  .to(\".flyingBox\", 2, { x: 100, scale: 1.5 })\n  .to(\".floatingBox\", 3, { x: 10 })\n  .to(\".flippingBox\", 1, { rotation: 360 });\n```\n\n---\n\nYou may see references around to multiple varieties of tweening and timelines called `TweenMax`, `TweenLite`, `TimelineMax`, and `TimelineLite`.\n\nIn late 2019 GSAP [updated to version 3](https://greensock.com/3-release-notes) and got rid of the all lite / max varieties so feel free to ignore that distinction in older code examples or.\n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n","data":{"title":"The Bare Essentials of Greensock","description":"Notes on the basics of the Greensock animation llibrary","updated":"2020-09-08","startDate":"2020-09-08","type":"note","topics":["Scrollytelling","Design","JavaScript","Web Development","Greensock","Animation"],"growthStage":"budding"},"slug":"greensock-essentials","filePath":"greensock-essentials.mdx"},{"content":"\nA gift economy is a _system of exchange_ based on gift giving.\n\nValuables are given without explicit agreement of future rewards between individuals, or within a contained community of people.\n\n\u003cBasicImage\n  width=\"880px\"\n  alt=\"Gift economies are systems of exchange based on gift-giving\"\n  src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dg3gyk0gu/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto,q_auto:best,w_1200/v1589328834/maggieappleton.com/notes/gift-economy.jpg\"\n/\u003e\n\nGift economies have a few key qualities. They are...\n\n1. **Loosely and informally tracked** - it is bad form to calculate the exact value of gifts you receive, or keep an obsessive log of it the way we do with business finances\n2. **Indirect** - it is not always two individuals giving back and forth. Instead gifting is generalised to a whole community where you may give to people who have not given directly to you\n3. **Delayed** - we do not reciprocate gifts the minute we receive them, but instead wait to repay the offering at a later date\n\nThe emphasis in a gift exchange is on **strengthening the bond between the givers and receivers.**\n\nIt creates a kind of \"positive debt,\" where two people or groups are now tied to one another - one party will always owe the other something. It's a purposeful way of entwining lives and communities together.\n\n## Why do we feel compelled to reciprocate gifts?\n\nThe grand mystery of gifting and gift economies is why we feel _obliged_ to reciprocate. When someone gives you something, it sparks a strong desire to return in kind.\n\nWe don't have a pat answer to where this compulsion comes from, but we can certainly argue generosity and social connection are useful evolutionary traits if we want to get biologically reductive about it.\n\n[Marcel Mauss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcel_Mauss) is perhaps the most infamous Anthropologist to explore this question in his book [The Gift](https://www.librarything.com/work/69346) \u003cFootnote idName={1}\u003eNot to be mistaken with [Lewis Hyde's book](https://www.librarything.com/work/258760) of the same name, although it's more focused on art and creation as a gift. Not a bad read, but a bit of a title hijack.\u003c/Footnote\u003e\n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n\u003cResourceBook\n  url=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/201766.The_Gift\"\n  image=\"/images/books/gift.jpg\"\n  title=\"The Gift\"\n  author=\"Marcell Mauss\"\n\u003e\n  An anthropological classic on gift theory and gift economies. Published in\n  1923, Marcel Mauss explores how systems of exchange work in traditional\n  societies around the world in relation to politics, power, and kinship.\n\u003c/ResourceBook\u003e\n\nMauss concluded that the objects we are given _\"are seen to partake of something of the personality of the giver\"_. 154\n\nMauss described it through the idea of the Maori idea of **hau** - the \"spirit of the gift\" where the giver's 'soul', or some kind of personal quality, is entangled with the gift object that wishes to return home to its owner. Thus compelling the receiver to make a return.\n\nThis interpretation of Maori **hau** ended up being strongly criticised as a misunderstanding and vast oversimplification of the true cultural meaning.\n\nBut the deeper idea Mauss was trying to get at is still worth highlighting. Just without a culturally appropriated term.\n\n## Reciprocating Appropriately\n\nWhen we return a gift, our offering has to be of **similar or slightly higher value** than the original. But not by too much.\n\nIf you bring me a ginger biscuit with my cup of tea, and two days later I reciprocate with a gourmet, two-tiered red velvet cake with your name in icing, we would all consider that an awkward, creepy, and overall a socially inappropriate response.\n\nJust giving you a ginger biscuit back works well enough. Returning a gift of the exact same value resolves the debt, but also breaks the cycle.\n\nEveryone is now even, and there’s no more need to continue biscuit-gifting. We can safely return to the pre-biscuit-gifting-days, but doing so also weakens our social connection.\n\nIf I have a particular political or personal interest in strengthening our social relationship, I need to give you a treat of slightly higher value – perhaps a chocolate hobnob or home-made scone.\n\nWhich both demonstrates I'm invested in this relationship, and also leaves you slightly indebted to me, thus compelling the gift cycle onwards.\n\n## Gift Economies and Market Economies\n\nWe often contrast the Gift Economy with the Market Economy. This is a wild oversimplification, but humans like to think in Cultural Dichotomies.\n\n\u003cBasicImage\n  width=\"840px\"\n  alt=\"We often contrast gift economies with market or barter economies\"\n  src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dg3gyk0gu/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto,q_auto:best,w_1200/v1596572154/maggieappleton.com/notes/market-barter-economy.png\"\n/\u003e\n\nMarket Economies are _systems of exchange based on buying and selling things with money_. A market exchange is **specific, quantifiable, direct, immediate, founded upon an explicit agreement**. As in, this croissant costs £1 right now.\n\nBuying an irrationally overpriced granola bar from an airport vending machine is an example of a pure market exchange without a social layer. It’s me, a machine, and a £3 bar of sugar to help me survive this long layover.\n\nI want food, and whoever owns this machine wants money. This is not the time or the place for a gift economy. It would be terribly inconvenient for me to rely on an unpredictable system of granola bar gifts from the strangers around me while starving in an unfamiliar airport.\n\nThere are humans who own this vending machine, who will eventually get that money. But they are very far away in time and space – both geographically and socially.\n\nIf challenged, I would have a terrible time tracking them down and having a chat. I have only the weakest sense of a human relationship with them, and there is hardly a social bond being woven – this granola bar is about an immediate and specific exchange of needs.\n\nHere, the market economy works wonders. Life necessities like food, shelter, and water are not good candidates for a gifting system. Which is why we tend to gift luxury items, novelties, and socks.\n\nThis is also why it's problematic when food, shelter, and water are framed as \"gifts\" which is sometimes how charitable donations work – as _optional_ acts of generosity.\n","data":{"title":"The Gift Economy","description":"Illustrated notes on the idea of Gift Economies and cultural historys of economic exchange","aliases":["gift economies","Gift Economies","Gift Economy"],"updated":"2020-08-03","startDate":"2020-08-03","type":"note","topics":["Anthropology","Economics","Illustrated Notes"],"growthStage":"budding"},"slug":"gift-economy","filePath":"gift-economy.mdx"},{"content":"\n\u003cIntroParagraph\u003e\n\nWe all know the \"head the family\" is not just referring to a floating human head, but instead the entire person who holds the power in a family unit.

Quite the opposite.\n\nAll the papers makes clear that collaboration in and of itself doesn't magically produce understanding. **Instead, it needs to be designed, structured, and carefully facilitated to lead to learning.**\n\nThe most effective techniques are not surprising...\n\n- Meaningful discussion, debate, and negotiation that forces us to question our assumptions and revise our conclusions.\n- Explaining your thinking to another human, out loud or in writing, quickly shows how well you know the material.\n- Solving a problem, then comparing your solution to someone elses, and mutually agreeing upon the strengths and weaknesses of each.\n\nMost of the research focuses on designing these intentional collaborative experiences. As well as the systems that make them possible (aka. apps, tools, platforms, all that jazz).\n\nThese are not new pedagogical findings, but CSCL is exploring how digital mediums are particularly well-suited to enabling them. Not just within small groups, but at scale.\n\nComputer magic means we can have multiple, intertwining discussions all going on simultaneously. With a far wider range of expertise, experiences, and perspectives. Hence, Twitter.\n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n\u003cTwoColumn maxWidth=\"1200px\" alignItems=\"flex-start\"\u003e\n\n\u003cSimpleCard alignLeft\u003e\n\n\"Collaborative Learning does not just mean that individual learning is enhanced by participation in small groups; \u003cmark\u003eit means that it is the groups themselves that learn.\"\u003c/mark\u003e Knowledge is a product of the collaboration process: it \u003cb\u003earises through interaction of different perspectives\u003c/b\u003e, heats up in the cauldron of public discourse, is gradually refined through negotiation, and is \u003cb\u003ecodified and preserved in cultural or scientific artifacts\u003c/b\u003e\"\n\n\u003cp className=\"subtext\"\u003e\n  Computer Support For Collaborative Learning: Foundations for a CSCL Community\n  – \u003ca href=\"http://www.gerrystahl.net/hci/cscl2002intro.pdf\"\u003eStahl (2002)\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003c/SimpleCard\u003e\n\n\u003cSimpleCard alignLeft\u003e\n\n\"Collaboration leads to positive outcomes only when students engage in **knowledge generative interactions** such as **giving explanations**, and engaging in **argumentation, negotiation, conflict resolution or mutual regulation**\"\"\n\n\u003cp className=\"subtext\"\u003e\n  Designing Integrative Scripts –{\" \"}\n  \u003ca href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227598981_Designing_Integrative_Scripts\"\u003e\n    Dillenbourg and Jermann (2007)\n  \u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003c/SimpleCard\u003e\n\n\u003cSimpleCard alignLeft\u003e\n\n\"The occurrence of **knowledge-generative interactions** is not a\ngiven: such \u003cmark\u003einteractions do not necessarily emerge spontaneously\"\u003c/mark\u003e (Cohen 1994; Salomon and Globerson 1989)\n\n\u003cp className=\"subtext\"\u003e\n  Computer Supported Collaborative Learning and Intelligent Tutoring Systems –{\" \"}\n  \u003ca href=\"https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~bmclaren/pubs/TchounikineEtAl-CSCLandITS-ITSBook2010.pdf\"\u003e\n    Tchounikine, Rummel, and McLaren (2010)\n  \u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003c/SimpleCard\u003e\n\n\u003c/TwoColumn\u003e\n\n### Creating Structure with Macro-scripts\n\nIt quickly became clear that **macro-scripts** are the bread and butter of CSCL systems. These are the [[Pattern Languages]] of the field that create structured collaboration.\n\nCSCL Macro-scripts describe how a learning experience will play out.\nOn a general level, they define **a sequence of activities** focused around **a learning goal.** The learners all have assigned **roles** and follow a set of **constraints and rules for interaction.**\n\nIt sets up the whole dinner party for you, so participants can just show up and know all the learning logistics are taken care of.\n\nThat might sound a bit prescriptive. Until you realise every social interaction you engage in works this way. But most of the time our scripts and roles are so internalised they become invisible.\n\nWhen we walk into a grocery store we play the role of shopper and follow the put-stuff-in-basket script. It would be disastrously off-script to begin eating a fresh croissant while standing in the bakery aisle, or to walk behind a checkout counter and begin scanning our own groceries.

Instead of one leader or instructor talking **at** many people, it's many people all talking **to** each other.\n\nDavid Gasca wrote up a \u003ca href=\"https://medium.com/swlh/the-silent-meeting-manifesto-v1-189e9e3487eb\"\u003ecomprehensive manifesto\u003c/a\u003e on the phenomenon in 2019 that dives into the implementation details for using them at companies.\n\nWhile it's a great concept for Corporateland, I'm keen to explore how we could use it for collaborative learning communities online.\n\nMany of my [[Cozy Web]] communities are full of voracious readers. We're often looking for ways to run ad-hoc book clubs and reading groups, but the established formats are fairly vanilla. Standard Zoom calls. Or async stream discussions in Slack-esque apps.\n\nThe tools are janky. The [[Pattern Languages]] aren't well established. Systems like [[the Knowledge Hydrant]] give us good starting points, but aren't design with an online environment in mind.\n\nOne challenge of distributed learning is the coordination around timing. **Async reading doesn't focus collective attention in one place at one time.**\n\nPicking a single time to 'meet' in a document gives people a structured frame to fully focus on reading, thinking, and discussing\n\nThe opportunity to follow up with a video or voice call right after also creates space for social bonding, nuanced conversations, and collaborative meaning-making. It prevents Twitter-esque brutality and presumptive misunderstandings.\n\nI'm beginning to try this out.

Because in order to visually explain something _well_, you need to truly understand it.\n\nWhen we draw there are no vague relationships or fuzzy edges.  \nYou have to make clear how all the parts of a system are related.  \nWhat's above and below. What's a container and what's a substance.  \nWhat actions and events are happening between elements.\n\nIt requires a nuanced understanding of the material.\n\nMy old beginners notes are still useful - they make the implicit explicit.\nThey explain concepts the expert would never think to.\n\nBut they also fall short in lots of ways. I make mistakes. I skim the surface of material. I can't dive deep on technical details.\n\nCollaborative workshopping gives us the best of both worlds. I still get to ask dumb questions (purposefully), like **\"is the React app above or below the GraphQL request?\"** or **\"does an S3 bucket have a lid?\"**\n\nIt's the Socratic method for visual thinking.\n\nAsking these odd questions helps us establish a vocabulary of shapes, sizes, colors, metaphors, and spatial relationships.\n\nOur instructors have the deep context to answer these kind of questions well, and reason through why certain visual arrangements make more sense than others.\n\nI'm just there to prod them in certain directions, and add a bit of polish afterwards.\n\nWe're doing plenty more of these.

With socks. And personal assistant bots. I know, you're already so excited.\n\n\u003c/IntroParagraph\u003e\n\n**Immutability** and **state** are two developer buzzwords it took me forever to \"get.\"\n\nTheir underlying meanings aren't necessarily that complex. But it's tough to fully comprehend what they mean, and why they're important, until you see them in action.\n\n[State](\u003chttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_(computer_science)\u003e) just means the way an application is at a single point in time.\n\nFor example, if we've typed _\"how does CSS grid work\"_ into the search bar, and there are three checkboxes ticked, and we have a dropdown menu open that's the current \"state\" of things. If we close the menu that's a state change.\n\nBehind the scenes in apps we have to account for every state an app could be in (which gets expontential very quicky). This is usually called [\"managing state\"](https://codeburst.io/state-management-in-javascript-15d0d98837e1) and appears to be a [neverending problem](https://medium.com/razroo/the-history-of-javascript-state-management-in-2019-161491d588ed)\n\n\u003e **Immutable State** is one approach to solving our complex state problem – it simply means making a second copy of things before you change them.\n\nIt's the same as copying and pasting a new _ImportantThing_Version2_Draft.md_ document before liberally changing enourmous chunks of it.\nThen when you realise your poor editing choices and want to go back to the original version, it's there waiting for you.\n\nWriting [immutable code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immutable_object) is a [wildly](https://medium.com/tribalscale/understanding-immutability-fdd627b66e58) [popular](https://itnext.io/why-concept-of-immutability-is-so-damn-important-for-a-beginner-front-end-developer-8da85b565c8e) concept in general. And a good idea when you don't want to muck everything up.\n\n---\n\nOkay now you're all caught up on the jargon. Lets get to some illustrated notes.\n\nThese are from a course [Michel Weststrate](https://twitter.com/mweststrate) made about their elegant new tool [Immer](https://immerjs.github.io/immer/docs/introduction) – it helps handle manage immutable state in a sane way.\n\n\u003cImageLink href=\"https://egghead.io/courses/immutable-javascript-data-structures-with-immer\"\u003e\n  \u003cImageFrame\n    width=\"800px\"\n    alt=\"Immutable JavaScript Data Structures with Immer\"\n    src=\"https://og-image-egghead-course.now.sh/immutable-javascript-data-structures-with-immer?af=54fd64\"\n  /\u003e\n\u003c/ImageLink\u003e\n\nMichel walks us through building a gifting app with React \u0026 Immer that seamlessly handles all the messy state work.\n\n\u003cBasicImage\n  width=\"1100px\"\n  alt=\"Immer is a small JS library that makes working with immutable state easy and enjoyable.

The layouts, icons, and button arrangement haven't moved. Address bar at the top. Arrow icons to move between pages. Access to the same basic controls; print, refresh, save, and search.\n\nModern Chrome certainly gained the veneer of minimalist modern design; we've reduced the interface to a low-contrast sea of whitespace. It's also vastly more powerful; 1993 Mosaic certainly couldn't load 20 tabs running WebGL animations.\n\nBut from a user's perspective, the core browsing experience isn't different. Enter URL, load the page, click on links, move forwards and backwards in browser history. We can only see one website at a time, or max two if we stack our browser windows in columns.\n\nChrome and Mosaic are not uniquely similar. All the major characters in this browser drama – Firefox, Safari, Opera, and Internet Explorer/Edge – feel like they're wearing the same outfit.\n\nThis historical consistency is impressive. Perhaps it means we nailed this interface pattern on the first try. Or perhaps it means building browsers is an enourmously complex challenge, and the only companies with enough engineering resources to dedicate towards it aren't interested in mucking about. They're too busy keeping up with W3C web standards and negotiating cross-compatability concerns, leaving little room for experimental interface patterns.\n\nThis isn't for lack of want though. There have been plenty of calls to _\"reinvent\"_ the browser. Places like [The Browser Company](https://thebrowser.company/) make a lot of noise about it (but we've yet to see a product demo). Foundations like Mozilla have funded extensive [experimental explorations](http://patrykadas.com/browser.html) of alternative browsers.\n\nThere's a steady stream of ideas and speculative sketches floating around Twitter that prompt us to reconsider our browsery assumptions and ask good design questions:\n\n\u003cTweetEmbed tweetId=\"1418749070336684034\" /\u003e\n\n\u003cTweetEmbed tweetId=\"1450479522609090562\" /\u003e\n\n\u003cTweetEmbed tweetId=\"1256317316452810755\" /\u003e\n\nThe dreams in some of these speculative suggestions are starting to materialise.\n\n\u003cSpacer /\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 className=\"micro\"\u003eThe Pattern\u003c/h2\u003e\n\nThere are some new apps appearing that offer alternative ways of browsing the web, but sidestep the problem of needing to build an entire browser.\n\nThrough the use of `\u003ciframe\u003e` embeds (or sometimes darker magic like live-updating screenshots in `\u003cimg\u003e` tags), these apps are creating a form of web inception; allowing us to embed tiny browser windows inside a larger canvas. \u003cFootnote idName={2}\u003eThis is a tricky as many websites deny access if they're embedded inside other webpages. This isn't out of malice; they're trying to protect themselves from cross-site scripting attacks\u003c/Footnote\u003e\n\nThis canvas-based approach adds _spatial_ dimension to the web browsing experience; they allow us to arrange browser windows above, below, to the left, and right of other browser windows.\n\nThe same way we're able to put an open book next to a piece of paper and below a row of sticky notes in meatspace. Arranging objects in space to create groupings, indicate relationships, and build hierarchies is one of those classical human skills that never goes out of style.\n\n#### Spatial Browsing Apps\n\n1. [Kosmik](https://lithium.paris/) is a canvas-based note-taking app for iOS and Mac app that includes frames for web browsing. It's still in early development, but as a native app it doesn't seem to have the same cross-site blocking issues as web apps.\n\n\u003cImageFrame\n  width=\"1200px\"\n  src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dxj9qr5gj/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto,q_auto:good,w_1200/v1642582738/maggieappleton.com/patterns/kosmik_rm0rpy.jpg\"\n  alt=\"A Kosmik canvas with three open browsers arranged next to one another\"\n/\u003e\n\n2. [Nette](https://www.nette.io/) is a browsing app designed for researchers that allows you to open multiple browser windows, draw physical connections between frames, pull out key concepts, and write markdown notes directly into your canvas. \u003cFootnote idName={3}\u003eStill pre-release but looking promising\u003c/Footnote\u003e\n\n\u003cImageFrame\n  width=\"1200px\"\n  src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dxj9qr5gj/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto,q_auto:good,w_1200/v1642543667/maggieappleton.com/patterns/nette_kjqsgj.jpg\"\n  alt=\"A Nette canvas with open browsers, diagrams, and notes arranged next to one another\"\n/\u003e\n\n3. [Sprout](https://sprout.place/) is designed with social interaction in mind – an open, multiplayer canvas where you can video/voice chat, write notes, and browse webpages together. It cleverly sidesteps the issue of cross-site blocking by using screenshots in `\u003cimg\u003e` tags instead of true `\u003ciframe\u003e` elements.\n\n\u003cImageFrame\n  width=\"1200px\"\n  src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dxj9qr5gj/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto,q_auto:good,w_1200/v1642543667/maggieappleton.com/patterns/sprout_ffcyrn.jpg\"\n  alt=\"A Sprout canvas with two open browsers arranged next to one another\"\n/\u003e\n\n4. [Natto.dev](https://natto.dev/) isn't designed to be a browsing or knowledge management app, but inadvertently implements this pattern. It's a spatial canvas for programming that happens to allow HTML elements, such as `\u003ciframe\u003e`:\n\n\u003cImageFrame\n  width=\"1200px\"\n  src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dxj9qr5gj/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto,q_auto:good,w_1200/v1642543667/maggieappleton.com/patterns/natto_cfqkov.jpg\"\n  alt=\"A Natto canvas with three open browsers arranged next to one another\"\n/\u003e\n\nAll of these examples allow you to add different blocks and elements to your canvas other than simply browsers. This turns the interface into a true research space. You can add notes, images, and links connected to these browsers – pulling out information in order to arrange it in ways that make sense to you.\n\nAt least... in theory. The above platforms are promising, but they're all at beta/alpha stage for the moment. They're worth playing with, but not stable enough to build up an extensive database of notes and browser trails in.\n\nWe're so close though. Here's to hoping we have widely useable spatial browsing tools within the next year or two.\n\n#### Postscript\n\nI should touch on the impulse to bring in even more dimensions here. When you search for \"_spatial web browsing_,\" you'll find there are whole engineering teams trying to stick web browsers on [walls within 3D AR/VR](https://venturebeat.com/2021/05/13/spatial-unveils-web-browser-collaboration-in-3d-workspace-and-nft-virtual-galleries/) environments. To me this feels like putting the cart before the poorly rendered, nausea-inducing horse, given we haven't built tools to properly browse the web in 2D space yet.\n\n\u003cReferences\u003e\n  \u003cReferencesLink\n    title=\"Browser.html speculative research\"\n    href=\"http://patrykadas.com/browser.html\"\n    author=\"Patryk Adas\"\n  /\u003e\n  \u003cReferencesLink\n    title=\"Spatial Interfaces\"\n    href=\"https://darkblueheaven.com/spatialinterfaces/\"\n    author=\"John Palmer\"\n  /\u003e\n  \u003cReferencesLink\n    title=\"Spatial Software\"\n    href=\"https://darkblueheaven.com/spatialsoftware\"\n    author=\"John Palmer\"\n  /\u003e\n\u003c/References\u003e\n","data":{"title":"Spatial Web Browsing","description":"Adding spatial affordances to the experience of browsing the web","startDate":"2022-01-14","updated":"2022-01-19","type":"pattern","topics":["The Web","Design"],"growthStage":"budding"},"slug":"spatial-web","filePath":"spatial-web.mdx"},{"content":"\n\u003cAssumedAudience\u003e\n  Active readers and writers of the web.

Most algorithm-driven interfaces blackbox their internal logic and decision-making rules. Faced with these opaque systems, we end up fetishising the algorithms – we attribute human agency and capacities to them, and in doing so hide the very real human agents designing and maintaining them. We call them \"magic\" to dismiss the need to make them legible to users.\n\nAs an audience we have no visibility into what metrics the engineers are optimising for. The engineers themselves don't always understand how the algorithms choose what to recommend. The lack of transparency makes it difficult to understand why we're shown certain content.
