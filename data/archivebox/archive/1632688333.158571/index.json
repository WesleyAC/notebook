It premiered on March 5, 2020, on FX on Hulu.[2][3]\nLily Chan (Sonoya Mizuno) is a software engineer for Amaya, a quantum computing company run by Forest (Nick Offerman). Lily soon becomes embroiled in the mysterious death of her boyfriend, who died on the first day of his new job at Devs.[2][4][5] The series explores themes related to free will and determinism, as well as Silicon Valley. It received generally positive reviews, with critics praising its imagination, cinematography, acting, and soundtrack.[6]\n\n\n\nCast and characters[edit]\nMain[edit]\nSonoya Mizuno as Lily Chan, a software engineer at Amaya\nNick Offerman as Forest, CEO of Amaya\nJin Ha as Jamie, a cybersecurity specialist and Lily's ex-boyfriend\nZach Grenier as Kenton, head of security at Amaya\nStephen McKinley Henderson as Stewart, a member of the Devs team at Amaya\nCailee Spaeny as Lyndon, a member of the Devs team specializing in work on sound waves.

The pilot was written by Alex Garland who also directed and executive produced the episode as well.[9] On July 23, 2018, Rob Hardy mentioned in an interview that he would serve as the cinematographer for the series.[10]\nOn August 3, 2018, it was announced during the Television Critics Association's annual summer press tour that FX had decided to bypass the pilot process and instead were giving the production a straight-to-series order consisting of eight episodes. Additional executive producers include Andrew Macdonald, Allon Reich, Eli Bush, and Scott Rudin.[4]\nGarland appeared at the New York Comic Con and explained his reasoning behind the creation of the series: \"I read more about science than anything else, and it started with two things. One was getting my head around this principle of determinism, which basically says that everything that happens in the world is based on cause and effect...That has all sorts of implications for us. One is that it takes away free will, but the other is that if you are at a computer powerful enough, you could use determinism to predict the future and understand the past. If you unravel everything about you, about the specifics of you why you prefer a cup of coffee to tea...then five seconds before you said you'd like to have a cup of coffee one would be able to predict you'd ask for it.\"[11] In November 2019, it was announced the show would premiere on Hulu instead of FX, as part of \"FX on Hulu\".[12] On January 9, 2020, it was announced that the series would premiere on March 5, 2020.[3]\n\nCasting[edit]\nAlongside the series order announcement, it was confirmed that Sonoya Mizuno, Nick Offerman, Jin Ha, Zach Grenier, Stephen McKinley Henderson, Cailee Spaeny, and Alison Pill had been cast in the series' main roles.[4] Amaya Mizuno-Andr\u00e9, who plays Forest's daughter Amaya, is Sonoya Mizuno's niece.[13]\n\nFilming[edit]\nFilming on the series had begun by August 2018, with scenes shot at UC Santa Cruz.[14]\n\nRelease[edit]\nThe first teaser for the series was released October 5, 2019.[15] The first two episodes of the series were released on March 5, 2020, with the rest debuting weekly on Hulu under the label \"FX on Hulu\".[3] In India, the series premiered on Hotstar on March 6, 2020.[16] The series premiered on BBC Two in the UK on April 15, 2020, with the whole series available on iPlayer at the same time.[17] On September 23, 2020, Fox Greece picked up the series and began airing it on September 28, 2020.[18]\n\nReception[edit]\nAs of August 2020, the series has an 81% rating with an average score of 7.64 out of 10 based on 85 reviews on Rotten Tomatoes. The site's critical consensus reads: \"A hauntingly beautiful meditation on humanity, Devs' slow unfurling may test some viewers' patience, but fans of Alex Garland's singular talents will find much to chew on.\"[19] On Metacritic, it has a score of 70 out of 100 based on 31 reviews, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[20]\nBrian Tallerico of RogerEbert.com wrote a highly positive review and called it \"stunningly ambitious\" and stated \"It's ultimately an unforgettable and rewarding experience\". Tallerico praised Garland's work and concluded by writing, \"one of the best new shows in a long time.\"[21] CNN's Brian Lowry gave it a positive review, summarizing that it is \"a mind-blowing concept that doesn't entirely come together at the close, but which remains unsettling and provocative throughout\".[22]\nIn a more mixed review from The New York Times, James Poniewozik wrote that \"It showcases what Garland does well\u2014ideas and atmosphere\u2014while amplifying his weaknesses in character and plot. As the techies say, it scales\u2014for better and for worse\".[23] In a more negative review, Sophie Gilbert of The Atlantic wrote that \"Devs is only the latest in a series of puzzle-box shows more preoccupied with their own cleverness and their labyrinthine twists than with the burden of watchability.\"[24]\nThe New York Times interviewed theoretical physicist Sean Carroll about sweeping statements about humanity and determinism made by the creators of Devs and Westworld. When asked which show he preferred, Carroll responded, \"I was very impressed with how [Devs' creators] were doing something very, very different. I thought it was a very well done show. It was slow and contemplative, but that's a perfectly good change of pace from what we ordinarily see in action movies\".[25]\n\nAwards and nominations[edit]\n\n\n\nYear\n\nAward\n\nCategory\n\nNominee(s)\n\nResult\n\nRef.\n\n\n2020\n\nPrimetime Emmy Awards\n\nOutstanding Cinematography for a Limited Series or Movie\n\nRob Hardy (for \"Episode 7\")\n\nNominated\n\n[26]\n\n\nOutstanding Sound Editing for a Limited Series, Movie, or Special\n\nGlenn Freemantle, Ben Barker, Gillian Dodders, James Wichall, Danny Freemantle, Robert Malone, Dayo James, Nicholas Freemantle, Lily Blazewicz and Emilie O'Connor (for \"Episode 3\")\n\nNominated\n\n\nOutstanding Sound Mixing for a Limited Series or Movie\n\nLisa Pi\u00f1ero, Mitch Low, Howard Bargroff and Glen Gathard (for \"Episode 3\")\n\nNominated\n\n\nOutstanding Special Visual Effects in a Supporting Role\n\nAndrew Whitehurst, Sarah Tulloch, Anne Akande, Samantha Townend, Giacomo Mineo, Tom Hales, George Kyparissous, Stafford Lawrence and Jon Uriarte (for \"Episode 8\")\n\nNominated\n\n\n2021\n\nBritish Academy Television Craft Awards\n\nBest Photography & Lighting: Fiction\n\nRob Hardy\n\nNominated\n\n[27]\n\n\nCritics' Choice Super Awards\n\nBest Actor in a Science Fiction/Fantasy Series\n\nNick Offerman\n\nNominated\n\n[28]\n\n\nMotion Picture Sound Editors Awards\n\nOutstanding Achievement in Sound Editing - Sound Effects and Foley for Episodic Long Form Broadcast Media\n\nGlenn Freemantle, Ben Barker, Danny Freemantle, Nick Freemantle, Rob Malone, Dayo James, Lilly Blazewicz, Peter Burgis and Zoe Freed (for \"Episode 3\")\n\nNominated\n\n[29]\n\nSee also[edit]\nLaplace's demon\nReferences[edit]\n\n^ Naudus, Kris (February 18, 2020). \"Alex Garland's new show wants you to be scared of tech again\".
