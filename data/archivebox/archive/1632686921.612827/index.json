Although the Employment PASS Card is also a four-in-one certificate (resident visa, employment permit, ARC, and re-entry permit), qualified applicants are defined as those being white-collar foreign workers (Subparagraph 1 to 6, Paragraph 1, Article 46 of the Employment Service Act).\n\n\n\nQ2: What are the special rights and interests conferred by the Employment Gold Card?\n\nA2: Holders of Employment Gold Card enjoy the following rights and interests:\n\n1.

The spouse and minor children of the Employment Gold Card holders are eligible for residence in Taiwan.\n\n5. For the holders of Employment Gold Card who are employed in professional work in Taiwan, their spouse, minor children, and adult children who are unable to live independently due to physical or mental disability, having obtained documentary proof of residence, will no longer be subject to a 6-month wait for inclusion in NHI coverage.\n\n\n\nQ3: How to apply for Employment Gold Card?\u00a0 What are the fees involved?\n\nA3:\n\n1. The application of the Employment Gold Card is accepted online through the world-wide-website of National Immigration Agency, accessible either from within Taiwan or from overseas.\u00a0 Click \u201cENGLISH\u201d tab and choose Online Application >>9.

The criteria used to define each type of Foreign Special Professionals are issued by the following government departments:\n\n1. Science and technology (Ministry of Science and Technology).\n\n2. Economy (Ministry of Economic Affairs).\n\n3. Education (Ministry of Education).\n\n4. Culture and Arts (Ministry of Culture).\n\n5. Sports (Ministry of Education).\n\n6. Finance (Financial Supervisory Commission).\n\n7. Law and Architecture (Ministry of Justice,\u00a0 Ministry of the Interior)\n\n\n\nQ8: I have an Alien Resident Certificate (ARC). Can I keep the ARC upon approval of my Employment Gold Card?\u00a0 If I hold a valid Employment Gold Card and get approved of an ARC after applying by other causes, will my Employment Gold Card be cancelled?\n\nA8:\n\n1. The Employment Gold Card is a four-in-one cards that simultaneously works as work permit, residence visa, Alien Resident Certificate and Re-entry permit.\u00a0 There is no need for its holder to apply for another Alien Residence Certificate.\u00a0 To enforce the one-ARC-per-person policy for any foreigner residing in Taiwan, the applicant is given the option to make conversion between the ARC and the Employment Gold Card, but only one or the other.\n\n2. If you already hold a valid Employment Gold Card but apply for and got issued an Alien Resident Certificate by other reasons, the NIA are bound by law to cancel your Employment Gold Card, though not af-fecting your rights to residency.\n\n3. If you already have a valid ARC, be it by the reason of being an em-ployed white-collar worker or being the spouse of a registered ROC national, you are eligible for an Employment Gold Card once you meet the qualifications of a Foreign Special Professional.\n\n4. In addition, if you want to convert your ARC to an Employment Gold Card, the NIA will cancel your ARC once you apply for and get issued the latter.\n\n\n\nQ9: How does an Employment Gold Card applicant apply for a Resident Visa?\n\nA9: The applicant should upload the information page of his/her passport, which should be valid for at least 6 months, and a color passport-size photo with a white background taken within 6 months to Foreign Professionals Online Application Platform.
