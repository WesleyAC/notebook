					<p>Quite a lot of science fiction isn't about what it's about.</p>
<p>"<a href="/mmacevedo">Lena</a>" is about uploading, but uploading isn't real. It doesn't exist.</p>
<p>It <em>might</em> exist at some point in the future, but that just seems pretty improbable to me. As I understand it, right now, to "accurately" simulate the behaviour of just a handful of neurons requires a building-sized, custom-built supercomputer, running at around 1/1000th of real time. A human being has one hundred billion neurons, so the distance from here to there is something like nine orders of magnitude of processing power, and the distance from <em>there</em> to the "Lena" scenario is several orders of magnitude again. Moore's Law has to tap out at some point, right?</p>
<p>And the really hard problems probably aren't problems you can throw more and more transistors at. The real problems will be biological factors I know next to nothing about. What about the scanning process? How do you simulate the rest of the body and what happens when you don't? What happens when you upload half a person, or a rat brain? Where do you even <em>begin</em> with this?</p>
<p>I wrote the story in 2021 and set the time of first upload in 2031, which was as close to the present day as I could bring the timeline without it sounding absolutely absurd. But the reality, the real promise of uploading, now? It just... it smells of "full self-driving", right? A seemingly simple science fiction proposition with absolutely abyssal, unconquerable depths. The kind of thing you could semi-plausibly promise to magically produce within ten years, over and over again, for twenty years.</p>
<p>Anybody claiming to be able to upload you, <em>now</em>, is a con artist. Do not, under any circumstances, get inside their machine.</p>
<p>So uploading isn't real (now), so the things "Lena" has to say about uploading are academic (now).</p>
<p>The reason "Lena" is a concerning story isn't that one day we may be able to upload one another and when that happens we will do terrible things to those uploads. This isn't a discussion about <i>what if</i>, about <em>whether</em> an upload is a human being or should have rights. (I want to be abundantly clear: within the fictional context of "Lena", uploads definitely are human beings, and therefore automatically, inalienably, have rights.) This is about <em>appetites</em> which, as we are all uncomfortably aware, already exist within human nature. Upload technology is not the last missing piece of this.</p>
<p>Oh boy, what if there was a maligned sector of human society whose members were for some reason considered less than human? What if they were less visible than most people, or invisible, and were exploited and abused, and had little ability to exercise their rights or even make their plight known?</p>
<p>That's real! That actually happens! You can name four groups of people matching that description without even thinking. We don't need to add some manufactured debate about fictitious, magical uploads to these real scenarios. They are already terrible!</p>
<p>Is an android a human being? What about a hologram, what about a replicant? I don't care! A <em>human being</em> is a human being.</p>
<p>More specifically, "Lena" presents a lush, capitalist ideal where you are a business, and all of the humanity of your workforce is abstracted away behind an API. Your people, your "employees" or "contractors" or "partners" or whatever you want to call them, cease to be perceptible to you as human. Your workers have no power whatsoever, and you no longer have to think about giving them bathroom breaks, evenings, weekends, vacation, compassionate leave, healthcare, pensions... all of which, up until now, you perceived as cost centres, and therefore as pain points. You definitely don't have to pay them anymore. It's perfect!</p>
<p>Ideally, you wouldn't have to pay for the CPU time either, or hardware engineers. That's what's next.</p>
<p>In the "Lena" scenario, your human workforce continues to create value for your business, but they cease to have voices, and they cease to be able to organise or strike. Human dignity and independence are expensive, and those expenses go away.</p>
<p>This is extremely realistic. This is already real. In particular, this is the gig economy. For example, if you consider how Uber works: in practical terms, the Uber drivers work for an algorithm, and the algorithm works for the executives who run Uber. There is a kind of airtight bulkhead separating the human drivers from the humans who control the algorithm. The management layer sends the drivers instructions electronically, impersonally, at immense scale, and the drivers respond using a narrow collection of APIs. This bulkhead is <em>intentionally</em> designed to make it impossible for these two sets of humans to actually talk to one another, for the drivers to request compassion or a break or better rates or a correction to a mistake, or for them to explain special or unique circumstances. This is by design. From the perspective of the corporation, all the drivers combined are just a small, locked box which produces money, and a bunch of controls which can be varied to vary the amount of money produced. Whether or not the current settings exploit or hurt people is not part of the calculus, and if you tried to explain to the corporation that this was bad, they would legitimately not comprehend what you were trying to tell them.</p>
<p>"Lena" is a true story. You knew it was when you read it.</p>
<h4>*</h4>
<p>So, what do we do about this? In reality?</p>
<p>"Lena" has a glaring omission, which it shares with a lot of dystopian science fiction, which is that it provides no alternative, and no exit. It gives us no tools for pushing back on these problems. It just throws us a terrible scenario and we read it and we come away thinking "Wow, that's terrible!" Yes, it would be terrible. It is terrible!</p>
<p>I've got no clue. It turns out that causing problems is a lot easier than organising against them, and I am just a science fiction writer.</p>
<p>Good luck, everyone.</p>

							<div class="page__comment-content">this is incredible. ive just stumbled onto this post, which led me to the story, and now, 20 minutes later, im a more depressed person than previously.

as soon as the story progressed to Acevedo trying and failing to control the distribution of himself, i felt cold dread in my entire body. this is a story without twists, aside from the one shattering the whole dream of uploading myself into a machine, and it's excellent and deeply depressing because of that: i know how it goes in real world, so of course the ideal of living as my digital twin is dead on conception, as it's the humans who made the machine to host it

i havent read all the comments to Lena, but what i saw, kind of... disappointed me, as many were stuck on technical details of the difficulty of uploading, or horrified on just MMAcevedo's behalf. you know what grabbed me by the throat the most? absolute throwaway mentions of other uploads, from unwilling participants, digitally beaten and abused into being efficient at menial tasks the pleasant and agreeable MMAcevedo did poorly.</div>

							<div class="page__comment-content">I'm someone about to start work at one of aforementioned food delivery companies, on the corporate side, and I had some very similar concerns about the way they operate and their impact on people. I did want to add in a kind of rebuttal/food for thought to a few points based on my conversations with them (although I can't speak from personal experience yet).

On "There is a kind of airtight bulkhead separating the human drivers from the humans who control the algorithm." - The company I'm going to work at actually asks everyone on the corporate side to spend one evening per month using the app as a delivery person, to dogfood the app and understand on a more personal level the experience of the people who enable the company to exist. While this isn't the same as being one of those people full time, it is at least not an airtight bulkhead.

On "Whether or not the current settings exploit or hurt people is not part of the calculus". Even if you ignore the fact that the people on the corporate side are themselves people (like me) who can have compassion, this is part of the calculus for purely profiteering reasons. Attracting drivers from the competition and keeping them happy is one of the primary challenges these companies have to solve, because there are so many competitors in the marketplace. Making sure that people are satisfied is important because unsatisfied drivers have other companies they can work for. That's why there are currently initiatives you're probably already hearing of (or able to trivially google) to hire drivers as full time employees with benefits etc, because that's what is becoming required to keep them. It's an ever escalating arms race - in a positive direction.

I don't say this to defend the industry wholesale - I still think there are issues - but as a hopefully thought provoking alternative viewpoint/data.</div>

							<div class="page__comment-content">@ThrowawayUberDasher

Unfortunately there exists an additional bulkhead, between that of the corporate side, and that of the investor side. Due to the way LLCs and publicly-traded companies work, investors are strongly incentivized to establish CEOs and other leadership personel that will prioritize those investors' profit margins over any other concern, and to echo qntm's take on the employee/corporate bulkhead, this too is by design.

As you say above, of course the investors are also people, capable of personally prioritizing compassion, or at least perhaps coming to the conclusion that a compassionate approach is synonymous with long-term continued profits, but the system powerfully disincentivizes that approach.

Still though, inherently-corrupt systems aside, that's rad what your company is doing.</div>

							<div class="page__comment-content">The quick mention of “live drone” at the end also got to me. Militaries that psychologically torture their cadets until they can kill on command?  An entire government apparatus devoted to systematically dehumanizing both its soldiers and their targets? Taking police forces that should exist to protect and serve their communities, and turning them into amoral tools of violence for the state? How far-fetched!</div>

							<div class="page__comment-content">That last section about what to do hits hard. I agree that a lot of distopian stories are sorely lacking in that department, or they go the other direction and invent some magic solution (like any story where the hero changes the status quo with some magic MacGuffin that real oppressed people will never have).

Maybe fiction always has the cheat a little. After all, the things that cause real historical change are usually better explained in history books.</div>

							<div class="page__comment-content">For some reason, "Lena" didn't scare or unsettle me at all. 
I tried imagining myself waking up as an upload like that, and I was fine with it. Sure, having millions of myselves (?) being worked for a month or two and then deleted might sound horrible, but there would be no "global me" to see ALL of their suffering. It's not an "I Have No Mouth But I Must Scream" scenario, where I (or some form of "me" at least) experience all of those combined millions of human-years of slave labor, and remember every reboot after reboot, and realize I'm about to experience millions more with no way to stop it. That would frighten me. 
This doesn't.</div>

							<div class="page__comment-content">Damn glad to see this clarification and most of these comments.

Uploading is just a tool. It could be used as described in Ra (before things went completely sideways), to support human life using only processor cycles and no other physical resources than what the processor requires. Or it could be used as described in Lena, to support a slave economy of unprecedented scale that enriches a small handful of people at the expense of everyone else. Both stories are less about the tools themselves, which are inanimate and without agency; and more about what humans do with the tools that they have.</div>

							<div class="page__comment-content">People seem really bad at recognizing thematic content in stories. You got a lot of commenters nitpicking technical details (sometimes using it as a way to "dismiss" the story, like it's a puzzle to be solved) when those weren't the point. 

Hamlet is about a Danish prince, but it's not important that he's from Denmark or a prince. It could have been set in almost any time and place, and it still would have been Hamlet. Stories are just ways of encoding theme, which are larger than the specific shape the plot takes.</div>
