The card gives you the right to stay and work in Taiwan for 1 year to 3 years, and you can apply online without sponsorship. The card comes with open work rights, so you may work for any (or multiple) company in Taiwan or start your own business. You can bring your family with you, and visitor rights for parents and grandparents are also included. There are tax incentives for cardholders with high salaries. Qualification is based on an asssessment of your professional skills, you don&rsquo;t need to have already secured a job in Taiwan. The Gold Card costs between USD100 and USD310 depending on your nationality and the duration of your card. How long does the application take? A perfect application takes 30 days, if your supporting documents are accepted the first time around and there are no external factors (eg COVID-19 delays). If you are asked for tweaks to your supporting documents, expect 60+ days. Do I apply for the Gold Card personally, or should I ask my employer to do that? Generally you should apply personally. Employers can help with the process, but you do not need their sponsorship or support to apply for the card. Additionally, the card once issued contains an open work permit that allows you to work for any company. If someone is asking you for large sums of money to help with your gold card application, it could be a scam. What fees are involved in a Gold Card application? There is only one fee, which is paid through the Gold Card application portal. There are no separate visa or work permit fees. The fees varies if you apply from Taiwan or overseas, the duration of the visa, and your nationality. You can check the &ldquo;Fees for Employment Gold Card&rdquo; section of the application portal. Who can I talk to about this? If you&rsquo;d like to discuss: whether you should apply, benefits of the program, or any early questions: Read the Official Gold Card Website Ask help@taiwangoldcard.tw, the Gold Card Helpdesk run by the National Development Council Ask Contact Taiwan. They are a Government-funded organisation whose mission is to help you find a job. They&rsquo;ll direct you to the right place. Otherwise, specific questions should be directed to the government agency responsible: tax incentives: the National Tax Bureau&rsquo;s toll-free English line 0800-000-321 can sometimes provide some basic information about this, otherwise ask the Gold Card Helpdesk to get a specific Ministry of Finance contact. visas for your spouse/family: Contact NIA, again following up with the Gold Card Helpdesk if you encounter people who don&rsquo;t know what they are doing. Do you need to undergo a health check to apply for the Gold Card?

Your Gold Card is a four-in-one document that contains your work permit, residence visa, reentry permit and Alien Residence Certificate. You have open work rights and they do not need to apply for a work permit or visa for you. What happens if I lose my job? You may simply find a new job. Your Gold Card is not sponsored by your employer and will not be affected by a change of job. Can I setup a company and employ myself? Yes. With a Gold Card you are able to setup a Taiwanese limited liability company as a sole foreign investor without any minimum capital requirement, and you can employ yourself in that company since you already have a work permit through the Gold Card. You are also able to setup and employ yourself through a representative office if you just intend to represent a foreign company. Can I be self-employed? Yes. If you don&rsquo;t work for an employer and don&rsquo;t setup a company in Taiwan you can still be self-employed (either abroad or in Taiwan) while you have a Gold Card. Does the Gold Card provide an open work permit? Yes. You may work for any organisation (or many organisations at the same time) in any industry, in any job, provided it doesn&rsquo;t have licensing requirements that you don&rsquo;t meet. Is there a minimum salary requirement for Gold Card holders? Yes. It is one of: NT$23,800 a month, or NT$158 per hour for &ldquo;workers&rdquo; (Labor Standards Act Article 21) NT$47,971 a month for those performing &ldquo;specialised or technical work&rdquo; Despite many applicants qualifying for a gold card on the basis of previous employment with salary of greater than NT$160,000, this is not a minimum salary requirement. However, those applying under this category will have their financial data reviewed by the Ministry of Labor. The regulations allow the Ministry of Labor to revoke a work permit if they are not satisfied with the results of this review. Can I work for multiple companies at the same time? Yes. What is salary withholding tax? At what rate should my salary be withheld? In May each year you pay income tax on your earnings from the previous year. To smooth out your payments (and when the government receives money) a little, the Taiwanese tax system is designed so that your employer effectively pre-pays a little bit of your tax. To do that, they &ldquo;withhold&rdquo; a percentage of your salary payment each time you get paid and remit it to the government a few times a year. The tax you pay in May will be reduced by this amount. There are two common amounts you will see for salary withholding tax: 18% and 5%. For tax residents of Taiwan, employers should withhold 5% and non-tax-residents 18%. However, some companies work on the assumption that all foreign residents have a danger of leaving Taiwan each year before they achieve tax residency (i.e. less than 183 days). These types of companies typically withhold 18% from January to June, and 5% for the rest of the year, which protects the company from owing additional tax to the government if the employee leaves. Which withholding rate you are charged is not a large issue, as it directly contributes to your income tax payment. If you&rsquo;ve been charged too much, you will receive a refund from the government once you file your income tax. However, it is always worth talking with your employer to explain your circumstances and that you plan to reside in Taiwan long-term. Can I just not work at all? Here’s what we know: A gold card holder needs to do the things expected of talented professionals (i.e. work) during the term of their first card in order to qualify for a second card. (Source: NIA Gold Card Information Meeting, 2018) If qualifying under one of the the ‘salary’ criteria, the MoL will review your financial data (basically, your yearly tax return). If you do not pass the review, your work permit can be cancelled. (Source: Application Portal) It is rumoured that the primary usage of this cancellation clause will be to weed out people who have applied under false pretences. The warning’s prominent appearance during the application process sends a clear message. However, recall that gold card holders may enter Taiwan without having a job at all. It’s entirely reasonable that a new immigrant would take some time to establish their network and find employment. Six-month job seeking visas are available, so that’s a tacit acknowledgement by the government that it does take some time. The rules of administrative procedure in Taiwan require ‘fairness’ in their execution. Would it be ‘fair’ to cancel the work permit of a highly qualified individual who has taken six months to find a job, when others meeting lesser qualifications are given that time? Certainly not. What about taking a break? Here, the length and circumstances of the break should probably be taken into account. Between jobs, or just feeling burned out and need a few months? Surely OK. However, if someone’s primary stated intention of gaining residence in Taiwan was employment (gold card), and they did not gain employment for, say, more than two years, does that stated intention still hold up? Maybe not. Or maybe the relevant authorities will consider losing the ability to qualify for a second gold card sufficient motivation. Keep in mind: there is some precedent for your visa going away if the underlying purpose for your residence in Taiwan no longer applies. Students who don’t turn up to class have sometimes found this out the hard way. If you are in a situation where you think your circumstances might put you in jeopardy, the gold card office can point you to the right place.]",});this.add({"id":"4","link":"https://taiwangoldcard.com/application-faq/qualifications/","title":"Do I qualify?","body":"[In order to qualify for an Employment Gold Card your skills must be related to one of eight areas: Science and Technology, Economics, Education, Culture and Art, Sport, Finance, Law and Architecture. You must select which single ministry is most relevant, and in most cases also select a specific entry in the list of that qualifications in that particular area for your application. Use the Gold Card Qualification Check to find the relevant choices for you. Do I need to have a high salary to apply for a Gold Card? No. Some industries have a category where applicants with a salary greater than NT$160,000 qualify. However, this is only one category. To date, none of the categories other than the dedicated salary category have financial requirements. If you have skills, please consider applying regardless of salary! I currently live in Taiwan, can I apply for the Gold Card? Yes. You can apply from anywhere, even within Taiwan. If you have an ARC, you can still apply, the Gold Card will replace you ARC. If you have a tourist visa, the Gold Card will replace your tourist visa. I&rsquo;m a digital nomad / remote worker, is this card suitable for me? Can I be self-employed? Yes, this card is perfect for you, since it contains an open work permit that allows you to work for any employer. However, if you don&rsquo;t have a Taiwanese employer please see the answer to: I&rsquo;m a freelancer/I don&rsquo;t have an employer, how do I register with the NHI?. Is there a &ldquo;general&rdquo; application category or must I select a specific industry? There is no &ldquo;general&rdquo; application category. You must select a single ministry to assess your skills. Use the Gold Card Qualification Check to find suggestions. Does my professional services/sole proprietor/dividend income count towards the salary requirement for Gold Card application? Generally not, but it depends. The document requirements to prove an Article 1 (&ldquo;salary&rdquo;) application all talk about &ldquo;&hellip;verifying salary or income tax payment related to employment&hellip;&rdquo;. The most commonly accepted documents appear to be withholding tax statements from employers and income tax returns from a tax authority. Bank statements are generally not sufficient. If you don&rsquo;t have salary-based compensation for your employment, we recommend calling ahead. You may be able to make an argument if your freelance income looks a lot like salary (eg from the USA: &ldquo;7 Nonemployee Compensation&rdquo; on a 1099-MISC from before 2020 or a 1099-NEC form after 2020). Is there an age restriction? Not really.

All who are eligible for National Health Insurance (NHI) must enroll into the program, which provides comprehensive and inexpensive coverage. Eligibility varies slightly depending on your employment status. If you aren&rsquo;t eligible for NHI then there are also a range of local and international private health insurance options available. You can check the NHI website for more details. How do I enroll into the program If you have an employer in Taiwan then they will enroll you into the program. If you don&rsquo;t have an employer, and you are past the six month waiting period (see below), you can apply for your NHI card at your local national health administration bureau. The process is the same as for any resident in Taiwan. It usually takes around 1 to 2 weeks to receive your NHI card by mail (so make sure your registered address is up to date). You will receive a temporary insurance certificate that can be used in the meantime, until you receive your NHI card. In Taipei, you should go to the Ministry of Health and Welfare Health Insurance Department Building (衛福部健康保險署臺北業務組-健保大樓辦公室) next to NTU Hospital, a couple minutes walk from Taipei Main Station Exit M8. Enter the building, take a queue number on the 1st floor, and the staff will take care of the rest for you (English service provided). Remember to bring your Gold Card, passport, and a photo. How are NHI premiums paid You will receive your NHI premium payment bill by mail. After you have received your first bill, you can also register to pay online or by monthly direct debit with a Taiwanese bank account. Are my children and family eligible for a health insurance card? Yes. Once your spouse and/or any minor children receive their residence cards, they can register for their health insurance card as your dependants. They are immediately eligible and have no waiting period once you are enrolled in NHI, be sure to tell your employer about your dependants so they can update your enrollment information. I&rsquo;m a freelancer/I don&rsquo;t have an employer, how do I register with the NHI? At present, you must reside in Taiwan for a consecutive six-month period (or leave only once for less than 30 days) and apply directly with the NHI. There is currently a legislative push to improve this, lead by the National Development Council. I&rsquo;m employed by a local company, do I still need to wait for the six-month period for a health insurance card? You do not. Once the company registers your employment, you will be issued a health insurance card. When does the six-month waiting period start and end? For those who don&rsquo;t have a Taiwanese employer: If you applied for the Gold Card from abroad then the period starts when you enter Taiwan. If you applied for the Gold Card in Taiwan (e.g. on a tourist visa or visa-exempt) then the starting period is the &ldquo;issue date&rdquo; written on the card. The waiting period ends after 6 calendar months (on the date). For example, if your waiting period starts on May 15 then you can enroll for NHI on Nov 15. Am I allowed to leave the country during the six-month period wait? You are only allowed to leave once for less than 30 days. Note that when you are away from Taiwan, the six-month waiting period will be paused. It will resume once you return to Taiwan. For example, if you are in Taiwan for 3 months and then leave for 1 month, you will have to wait for 3 more months once you get back to Taiwan (7 months in total). I need a health insurance during the six-month waiting period - What are the solutions? We know it&rsquo;s not ideal, but here some ways our community has solved this problem: Find an employer, that will enroll you right after the start of the contract Get private health insurance. Other gold card holders might have some recommendations. You can ask the community and mention your nationality. Is NHI mandatory? You must enroll when you are eligible. The National Health Insurance program is compulsory. The National Health Insurance program is a compulsory social insurance program. By law, [&hellip;] foreign national living in Taiwan with an Alien Resident Certificate (ARC - Gold Card included), regardless of age, gender, or employment status, must enroll in the program when they met the enrollment qualifications. If you plan to leave Taiwan for more than six months you can either maintain or suspend your NHI. Refer to the NHI website for more information. What to Do If Going Abroad for More than Six Months Where can I see a list of NHI clinics close to me? The NHI mobile app has a map-based search of all NHI facilities. You can download it from the Google Play store and the Apple App Store How are NHI premiums managed? NHI premiums are based on your employment status and are calculated as a percentage of your monthly income (similar to a payroll tax in other countries).

If you have dependants, then your premium will increase based on the number of dependants. Some types of income attract a higher rate (e.g. bonuses and investment income).

Otherwise, it’s probably better to select the longest duration. There is no justification needed on how long you&rsquo;d like to stay. This costs more, but delays the hassle of finding the next visa (or going through the gold card application process again). You&rsquo;ll also be asked for a local address.

If it can do this itself (eg you apply based on the salary criteria and provide the right documents), your application will be swift (one case took just two days). Most likely, the Ministry of Labor will need call in the appropriate Ministry (eg &ldquo;Science and Technology) to assist. That Ministry will then create a custom panel of judges who are skilled in your area of application. This takes some time, and if you are skilled in a niche area expect the application to take longer than 30 days at this stage. If the status in the portal hasn&rsquo;t updated in a long time first try contacting the Gold Card Helpdesk. They will probably tell you that the application is with the relevant ministry for your skill set and provide contact details. You can also get a better ETA of how long could take each stage on Forumosa where applicants shared their application status. If not, try to contact the appropriate ministry yourself.

When starting an application from inside Taiwan, you will be asked what visa you hold. A common mistake is to select &ldquo;I entered R.O.C. with a visa of which the duration of stay is more than 60 days&rdquo; because you have a stamp in your passport that says &ldquo;90 days&rdquo;. However, unless you explicitly applied for a visa to come to Taiwan, you are probably here under &ldquo;visa exempt&rdquo; entry, which was another item on that list. The NIA looked up your visa status, found it incorrect, and rejected your application.

Renting is common in Taiwan, and there are a large range of types of dwellings available at diffrerent price points. The most popular property search website is 591. Unlike in some other countries, real estate agents offering rental properties in Taiwan are typically only brokers who present prospective tenants to landlords for a fee and you will normally deal directly with a landlord from lease signing onward. Standard leases are available from most convenience stores and it is common to use these. A one or two month deposit, refunded on leaving the property is common. Negotiation down from the advertised price is common. Properties close to MRT stations are the most desirable. If you are looking for newer, tall modern apartment buildings, these are known as &ldquo;電梯大樓&rdquo; and you can limit your search on 591 to this. Other search sites include myroomabroad and spacious. Can I purchase real-estate? In general, yes, if your country allows Taiwanese nationals to purchase real estate in your country. There are some restrictions, such as not being able to purchase farmland, or land related to a waterway or national defense. Does my card look any different from other types of ARC? Yes, the entire card is gold in colour. It also has slightly different information such as a different title (R.O.C. (Taiwan) Employment Gold Card), purpose of residence (Foreign Special Professional) and a label for your professional field. How do I register to use the e-Gate? Visit your local NIA service center or the immigration counter at an international airport and the officials there will guide you through the steps. What unofficial benefits does holding a Gold Card bestow? As the Taiwan government sees holders as &ldquo;worthy professionals&rdquo;, this could increase your standing in the eyes of certain people. Additionally, Sometimes the National Development Council or other government agencies invite us to parties or ask our opinions on certain matters. What happens if I change my address? You must log in to the Gold Card Application portal and update your details there within 30 days of moving. Address changes are free. How do I change my address? You must change your address online.

After you submit your updated information, you will receive an automated email that says “steps of the online payment and the delivery have been completed,” even though you did not actually have to submit payment for the address change. The &ldquo;Information Change&rdquo; will be processed and they will get back to you per email if things are missing. Your new Gold Card with the latest address will be available for collection within approximately two weeks. Don&rsquo;t forget to bring your passport, current Gold Card, and electronic “payment receipt” (which will show a “payment amount” of 0). Note: Family members of a Gold Card holder must update their address in person at the National Immigration Agency. What if I don&rsquo;t update my address? Legally, you are required to update your address within 30 days starting from the date you move in. Otherwise here is a non-exhaustive list of potential consequences: You could receive a fine between NT$2,000 and NT$10,000. Some government entities, such as the tax office or NHI, won&rsquo;t accept any other address than the one mentioned in your Gold Card. Important documents, such as the NHI invoices, will be sent to the address, and you might miss them. How many days per year do I have to stay in Taiwan? There are no requirements. However, you must stay for more than 183 days per year in order to be eligible for many benefits such as: tax resident treatment and a pathway to permanent residence.

How do I convert my overseas driving license? Taiwan has international agreements with many countries that allow you to convert your driver&rsquo;s license from your home country into a Taiwanese license without taking a driving test. This is done on the basis of &lsquo;reciprocity&rsquo; - basically if it is possible for a Taiwanese national to convert their license in your country you should be able to do the same in Taiwan. The Taipei City Motor Vehicles Office maintains a list of eligible countries (and states within countries), and instructions on their website. If you are not from an eligible state or country and need to drive long-term, you will need to sit the local license test. For the short term, you may use an International Driving Permit (IDP) from your home country, but after 30 days in Taiwan this must be validated by the local Motor Vehicles Office to remain valid. A validated IDP can typically only be used for a maximum of six months, after which you are supposed to apply for a Taiwanese driver&rsquo;s license. I am being asked to see an entry stamp in my passport, but I always use the eGate. What do I do? These days, most foreign residents of Taiwan use the eGate exclusively to enter and exit the country. It&rsquo;s fast and convenient, but it has the side effect that your passport is no longer stamped to mark your entry or exit. You may be met with confusion when explaining this to a bureaucrat in some situations. To solve this, you can visit your local National Immigration Agency service center and ask for a Certificate of Entry/Exit. It costs NT$100 and takes only a few minutes to produce.

According to NIA officials, no. They stress that this card is nonrenewable and you must go through the application process again toward the end of the gold card. One way of looking at that is that the Foreign Special Professional program could change to the point where one no longer qualifies. APRC is therefore “safer” in the long term. Consider also if the program doesn’t change. For instance, if you fall ill during the term and can’t demonstrate your gold card &lsquo;worthiness&rsquo; due to this, you’ll lose your visa when it runs out. Not so with APRC. It is also worth noting here that you don’t get the tax benefits if you’re an existing resident. Does holding a Gold Card make it easier to apply for Taiwanese Citizenship? There is no formal legislative relationship between the Gold Card and an improved chance at Naturalisation. Under Taiwan law, there are three types of Foreign Professionals: Foreign Professional Foreign Special Professional - Gold Card holders are classified as these Foreign Senior Professional - Plum Blossom Card holders are classified as this category. The law allows for those classified under this category to have an easier route to citizenship. However, it can&rsquo;t hurt your chances! Will switching from an employment ARC to a Gold Card affect my ability to get an APRC? The NIA has previously provided on-record assurances that there’s no issue here. You must ensure consecutive residence of five years to be eligible - no time gap between your employment ARC and your Gold Card. What is this job-seeking visa I heard about? Is it related to the Gold Card? It’s a separate visa to the gold card, that was introduced around the same time. You can get it if: You have a job where over the last 6 months, your average salary was over NT$47,971 Or, you don’t have a job, but you graduated from one of the top 500 universities in the world Or, you successfully apply to a government department to be deemed eligible in some other way and you have proof of: NT$100,000 in your bank account Health insurance to cover your trip Good conduct (eg a police report) There’s a brief news article here.

This time does not include periods of time you were studying and a few other exclusions, but any time you were here on a gold card does count. There are a few other requirements and documents to prepare, and application is done at the National Immigration Agency. Currently, the longest period a Gold Card can be valid is 3 years, so you will likely need to apply for a second Gold Card before you can be eligible for permanent residence.

There is a special form accessible from both the Alien e-Filing system and the paper-based tax return application. If I have worked in Taiwan before, can I apply for the tax break? Generally no, with some exceptions. The relevant regulations are here. You can see in Article 3 that you need 3 ticks to be eligible: First time coming to work It’s special professional work No household registration (only applicable to ROC nationals) and not a tax resident for the prior 5 years With the exception that: “If a foreign special professional has been previously approved to reside in the R.O.C. before his/her employment engaged in the professional work in the R.O.C., and such approval is not given on the ground of his/her engagement in the professional work, he/she shall not be subject to the first-time approval requirement…” Which is unclear.

You became a gold card holder in 2019, or later When do I become a tax resident of Taiwan? Tax residency in Taiwan is separate to immigration/visa residency and is based on the number of days you are physically in Taiwan. If you are in Taiwan for 183 days or more, you are a tax resident and must file taxes in Taiwan If you are in Taiwan for more than 90 days but less than 183 days you are not considered a tax resident but must still file a tax return in Taiwan For stays in Taiwan of less than 90 days per year, there are only limited cases you need to file a tax return. Further information is available from the National Taxation Bureau. When do I file tax in Taiwan? The financial year is January 1st to December 31st. Tax is filed each year from May 1st to the end of the month. 2020 benefits from an extended deadline due to the COVID-19. You are allowed to fill tax until the 30rd June 2020. How do I calculate my tax? A useful tax calculator is available here, if you need a rough estimate and can&rsquo;t work the official website. Where can I go for help with my taxes? The National Taxation Bureau provides free professional taxation consultation sessions in English and Japanese. The phone number is (02)2311-3711 ext 1116. During &ldquo;tax season&rdquo; there are dedicated English language counters for tax filing at National Taxation Bureau offices in major cities.

Where can I get a &ldquo;Certificate of Residence&rdquo; for tax purposes? Use the &ldquo;Individual Resident Certificate&rdquo; form provided by the National Taxation Bureau to request a certificate proving your tax residence is in Taiwan.

You can request this as soon as you become a tax resident, even if is your first year in Taiwan (i.e. haven&rsquo;t filed any taxes yet). In Taipei, download and print the form and bring it to the NTBT Head Office. The staff at the English language counters will help you fill it out and submit it for you. Note that only the first three questions need to be filled out for a &ldquo;Certificate of Residence&rdquo;. What is my Tax Identification Number (TIN)? Your Tax Identification Number (TIN) in Taiwan is your ARC number. My salary is paid by an overseas company, where do I pay tax? In general Taiwan, and sometimes also in the overseas country. If you stay in Taiwan for more than 90 days in a year, money you get for work you perform residing in Taiwan is considered Taiwan-sourced income. This is true regardless of whether your salary is paid to you in an account in Taiwan or overseas. Therefore, you will pay tax in Taiwan at the standard rates. You may refer to the National Tax Bureau&rsquo;s explanation, or the Income Tax law. However, paying tax in Taiwan does not necessarily free you of your tax obligations in other countries.

Though you may become eligible for other visas due to this, you may continue to use your Gold Card. If I switch from a Gold Card to permanent residence, can my family switch too? When you have been approved for permanent residence, your children (under 20) and your spouse may also apply for permanent residency if they have lived in Taiwan for more than 183 days per year for the past five years. Additionally, as a Gold Card holder your family members aren&rsquo;t required to show proof of financial ability like some other applicants for permanent residence. (Article 16) My child just turned 20, can they get their own work permit? Yes, provided they have lived in Taiwan from the time before they were 16 years old, for more than 270 days per year. (Article 17) Can my parents or grandparents come to visit? Yes, as a Gold Card holder, your parents and grandparents are eligible to apply for a 1 year multi-entry visa for a maximum stay of six months at a time. This visa can be extended in Taiwan to allow for a maximum stay of one year at a time. Contact your nearest Taiwan diplomatic post or the Bureau of Consular Affairs to apply.]",});this.add({"id":"15","link":"https://taiwangoldcard.com/goldcard-holders-faq/validity/","title":"Renewal & Validity","body":"[How long is a gold card valid? By default, between one and three years. If you are concerned your card (or underlying visa/work permit) may have become invalid or expired, you can check with the National Immigration Agency. Can I renew my gold card? A &lsquo;renewal&rsquo; is almost the same as a new application. Your &lsquo;renewal&rsquo; application will still go through skill assessment like your first one, and it has been stated that your activities in Taiwan during your first card will form part of the assessment. Keep this in mind when planning your time in Taiwan - you must still meet the qualification criteria in order to receive another card. As of February 2021, the &lsquo;renewal&rsquo; capability in the Application Portal has just become available. It is rumoured to be faster than a first-time application as parts such as the the passport verification step may be skipped. When does the gold card&rsquo;s validity begin? When the application is officially approved. You will receive an email from the application portal. Importantly: your cards&rsquo; validity can start before you enter Taiwan or pick up your card. Keep this in mind when planning your move to Taiwan.]",});this.add({"id":"16","link":"https://taiwangoldcard.com/goldcard-holders-faq/banking/","title":"Banking","body":"[General Guidelines Regardless of which bank you choose, you will need to follow the following procedures: Bring your Employment Gold Card and another proof of your identity (passport). Go to a bank near the address stated on your Employment Gold Card. For example, you cannot go to Xinyi to open a bank account if your residential address is at Sanchong. Prepare a local Taiwan number. This is needed for most banks to send OTP for login to your internet banking portal. Common features for all banks: Support multi-currency When receiving funds from overseas, every banks is legally required to call you to know the nature of those funds. All interest you&rsquo;ll receive from bank accounts in Taiwan will get automatically reported to the Tax office Bank Accounts CTBC Bank Minimum Deposit: You need to have bring along 1000 NTD for minimum deposit. Global Transfers: The bank charges 400 NTD administrative fees for any incoming foreign currency transfer into your bank account, regardless of amount. There&rsquo;s usually fees on the outgoing transfer from your foreign bank too, so your total fees might be more than 400 NTD. The incoming foreign currency fee can be waived once a month if you have 500,000 NTD in the bank account. User Interface: CTBC has internet banking on the web and mobile app. It provides the user interface in English and Traditional Chinese. It is quite user-friendly for your day-to-day usage. E-Sun Bank PayPal: If you want to use PayPal, only E-Sun can be used. Fubon Taipei Bank Minimum Deposit: There is no minimum deposit to setup a Fubon bank account. Global Transfers: The lowest fees for transferring money abroad. They charge $7 USD to receive USD SWIFT bank transfers (e.g. when transferring money using Revolut or TransferWise). User Interface: Accepts international numbers for SMS confirmations (2FA). Has an English website (but old). Mobile app in Chinese only. Foreigner Friendly: Depends on the branch. Most branches seem to have at least some English speaking staff. Multi-Currency: Yes Debit Card: Yes Mega Bank User Interface: Limited to Personal Account access. No access to business account before 6 months. English interface available. Citi Bank Foreigner Friendly: Appointment process could take a month, without guarantee to open an account. If you are interested in their &ldquo;Citibank® Global Transfers&rdquo;, it&rsquo;s only for Taiwanese citizens. HSBC Global Transfers: 3,000,000 NTD for their Premier account, and 500,000 NTD for their Advance account. Supports global transfers from other countries and local transfers. Transferring Money to Taiwan Revolut With a Revolut account, you can easily and cheaply transfer money to a Taiwanese bank account. Note that Revolut does not support NTD as a currency, so you have to transfer USD, which means that your Taiwanese bank account needs to support USD. Revolut charges 0.5% for foreign exchange exceeding ~$1000 USD per month. They also charge $3-4 USD for SWIFT transfers. Typically Taiwanese banks will charge a fee on incoming USD transfers (e.g. Fubon charges $7 USD), but they&rsquo;re USD to NTD rates are usually extremely good. With a free Revolut account ATM card you can withdraw up to ~$200 USD per month without any fees (after which they charge 2%). Bank of Taiwan and Fubon ATMs work well with Revolut cards and don&rsquo;t charge any fees. Some other banks may charge a fee! TransferWise Similar to Revolut, you can easily and cheaply transfer money to a Taiwanese bank account using TransferWise. Note that TransferWise does not support NTD as a currency, so you have to transfer USD, which means that your Taiwanese bank account needs to support USD. TransferWise charges $3.2 USD for SWIFT transfers. Their foreign exchange rate is roughly similar to Revolut. If you&rsquo;re source/sender currency is USD then you have to create a Same-Currency transfer and select USD. If you&rsquo;re source/sender currency is not USD then you have to select &ldquo;International&rdquo; and select USD as the recipient currency. Continue to the Recipient step and create a new Recipient. Select Taiwan and fill out the SWIFT code and Account number for your Taiwanese bank account.]",});this.add({"id":"17","link":"https://taiwangoldcard.com/goldcard-holders-faq/upcoming-changes/","title":"Upcoming Changes","body":"[On June 18th 2021, a major amendment to the law underpinning the Gold Card was passed by the legislature. It&rsquo;s since been signed into law by the President and is currently being implemented by the various government department responsible. At lot of things are still unclear. This page contains fully unofficial information based on what we know about the law, please confirm with relevant authorities before acting! When can I get the good stuff from the new law? October 2021. I can get permanent residence (APRC) after 3 years now? Yes, if: it&rsquo;s been more than 3 years (to the day) since you entered Taiwan on your Gold Card you spent an average of more than 183 days a year in Taiwan during those 3 years you didn&rsquo;t do any Bad Things while you were here Don&rsquo;t get confused: it&rsquo;s not calendar years, it&rsquo;s counted based on your first entry date, you cannot apply before 3 full years have passed regardless of how many days you&rsquo;ve been in Taiwan. One crucial thing: your Gold Card will probably expire before you reach the 3 year residence mark and are able to complete the application for permanent residence. Consider whether you need to start a renewal of your card early or apply for an extension. If there&rsquo;s a gap in your residence, you might become ineligible. Is this just for Gold Card holders? Yes, unless you have a Foreign Special Professional Work Permit (probably because you work in the offshore wind power industry, or some other highly specialised domain with an awesome HR department). How often does an APRC need to be renewed? This is permanent residence for life, you just need to visit Taiwan once every 5 years. Does my time on a regular ARC pre-gold-card count towards the 3 years? No. Though keep in mind &lsquo;regular&rsquo; APRC after 5 years is probably still an option for you. I hear tax benefits for Gold Card holders have been extended? Yes, the confusing deferral scheme has been replaced with a straight 5 year eligibility period. The benefit and qualification within a given year remains the same. Once I convert to APRC, am I still entitled to the same tax benefit as gold card holders? No, unless you get an additional Foreign Special Professional work permit. Are there any other changes when moving from Gold Card to APRC? Pretty much all of the other benefits you have as a Gold Card holder carry over, and you get some more. Never have to worry about your visa, ever again (provided you visit Taiwan once every 5 years) Automatic open work permit (work for any or as many employers as you want) Continue to be able to sponsor parents/grandparents for a longer visitor visa than other residents Continued access to National Health Insurance Your family can continue to stay with you :) Ability to apply for the Mackay Project, which provides benefits (eg discounts) after retirement (65 years old)]",});this.add({"id":"18","link":"https://taiwangoldcard.com/application-faq/known-limitations/","title":"Known Limitations","body":"[Even though the Employment Gold Card offers great benefits, you should be aware of the Known limitations before applying.]",});this.add({"id":"19","link":"https://taiwangoldcard.com/news/","title":"","body":"[Gold Card News 2021-09-11 Gold Card permanent residency FAQ 2021-09-06 Halt in Passport Inspection Stage of Gold Cards Announced From 7/27 to 9/20 2021-08-18 Gold Card holders give Taiwan high marks 2021-08-16 Amendments to Foreign Talent Act, an overview for Gold Card holders 2021-08-15 New fee structure for Gold Card applications and extensions 2021-08-11 Gold Card Community Guide To Taiwan 2021-08-02 3084 gold cards approved! 2021-07-28 Gold Card pick up location restricted to Taiwan 2021-07-06 Amendment to requirements in the Economy Gold Card category 2021-06-18 Amendments to Gold Card program approved 2021-05-13 Amendment to requirements in the Culture and Arts Gold Card category 2021-04-01 2447 gold cards approved! 2021-03-24 Taiwan Seeks More Foreign Finance Talent 2021-02-13 Pandemic success draws foreigners 2021-01-31 2127 gold cards approved! 2021-01-01 FAQ: Entering Taiwan during the COVID19 Pandemic 2020-12-25 Amendment for relaxing requirements in the Science &amp; Technology Gold Card category 2020-12-15 Amendment for relaxing requirements in the Finance Gold Card category 2020-12-15 Finance Qualifications to be Relaxed 2020-11-27 Basic Tax Workshop for Gold Card Holders 2020-11-18 Gold Card VVIP guests at 2020 Meet Taipei Startup Festival 2020-11-02 Gold Card Office Hosts &ldquo;What Resources are Available to You&rdquo; event for Entrepreneurs 2020-10-31 1532 gold cards approved! 2020-10-22 Ministry Of Justice amends Gold Card requirements in the Field of Law 2020-10-16 Gold Card Community Social at Haku 2020-09-30 1367 gold cards issued! 2020-09-28 President Tsai meets Gold Card Holders, and welcomes the 1000th 2020-09-14 Proposed updates to Foreign Talent Act 2020-09-11 Goldcard day trip to Yilan 2020-08-28 Goldcard holder: Chelsea Davis film festival 2020-08-14 Community Gathering 2020-08-01 Goldcard holder: Alvaro Trugeda art exhibition 2020-07-02 Community Gathering 2020-06-30 Almost 900 gold cards issued! 2020-06-12 President Tsai Promotes Gold Card 2020-06-05 Goldcard holder: Tomáš řízek illustration exhibition 2020-05-27 Goldcard holder: Starting an eye yoga career 2020-04-13 Tax payment has been extended to June 30th 2020]",});this.add({"id":"20","link":"https://taiwangoldcard.com/about/","title":"About this site","body":"[Since February 2018, when the Gold Card was launched, card holders have been helping people apply and integrate into life in Taiwan.

Taiwan is very strict about the rules: For example, if you stay in certain facilities, you will not even be given a key to your room. You will also need to purchase a SIM card (or provide one if you already have it) to authorities, who will use it to check up on your location regularly. They will check! You will need a room that can provide for at least one bathroom per adult. There is a list of government-specified hotels that can accommodate those in quarantine. These facilities will provide meal service. Some private facilities may house you, but you will need to check with them first. Many hotels may refuse to house you during the quarantine period. Some recent inbound travelers have booked AirBnB houses or cabins out in the middle of nowhere. I think in such a case, as long as it has a private area, you and the kids can spend time outdoors (unlike at a hotel). For ROC passport (with 身分證) holders, you may be eligible for a NT1,000/day stipend from the Taiwan government covering the cost of accommodations for the Quarantine period to compensate you for being locked up.

If you have the Employment Gold Card and want to be part to the community, feel free to fill the Google Form Hasnaa Fatehi, PhD, Economy Background: Moroccan with degrees in Science from France (Msc) and Germany (PhD), I was naturalized Canadian in late 2018. I completed my PhD in 2009 in the midst of the financial crisis. There were no European work permits to be provided for North-Africans like me, even with a PhD in Science. I applied for the Singaporean program EPEC, a grad student friend of mine had pointed me to, and was approved after three weeks only. I left for Singapore where I started my Regulatory career at P&amp;G, it was an amazing experience! Ironically, when I was contemplating applying for the TW Gold Card, I read that it was designed after the Singaporean EPEC. This is the point at which I knew I would qualify if I applied. I am very glad to be back to Asia. Why Taiwan?: The Medtech industry is very dynamic here with incredible talent and innovation that needs exporting. The pro-democracy spirit here is also something unique in Asia. Everything is open to discussion and while the Taiwanese are grappling with their identity, they understand what it means to be a silenced minority, listen with genuine curiosity to other groups and don&rsquo;t shy away from contributing to the world. I find the overall energy to be hopeful, inspiring and motivating. What are you currently doing in Taiwan?: Setting up a branch of my business in TW, building relationships particularly with local incubators and accelerator programs, seeking clients, and hopefully starting to make some money very very soon. Staying in Taiwan was not in my plan. I was going to be here for six months, accompany my partner for his exchange, take Chinese lessons, study for a professional certification exam, and do lots of business intelligence here, in China and Singapore. When the Covid outbreak happened my partner and I weighed every week the pros and cons of staying vs. returning to BC. Quickly after that I understood that I had before me a business opportunity, being in the MedTech industry, I could not turn away from. Manufacturing sites were still running in TW, large MedTech MNCs were/are still talking about deglobalizing and moving some of the manufacturing outside of China and President Tsai making MedTech a high priority sector. It was clear Taiwan was the place to be for my business. This is how I ended up applying for the Gold Card. Patrick Ng, Education Background: I&rsquo;m originally from Hong Kong and grew up in the United States. I have a BA from the University of Pennsylvania and an MBA and MPH from Boston University. My background is primarily in hospital administration, health policy research, and medical device startups. I am also involved in church and recently helped start Thrive Church that ministers to college students and young adults in Taipei. Why Taiwan?: I used to visit Taiwan almost every year for the past decade on work-related trips and saw just how amazing this country is and how friendly the people are. When an opportunity opened up to help in a research and education initiative in Taipei, it seemed like a great fit so my family relocated from Boston a couple years ago. As I have spent more time in Taiwan, it further cemented the feeling that we made the right decision: 1) convenience - efficient public transportation system in Taipei, 7-elevens on every block, restaurants and grocery stores within easy reach, 2) social equality - universal health care coverage and civil liberties, 3) people - warm, friendly, and helpful, 4) safe, and 5) Costco - there are 5 in Taipei! What are you currently doing in Taiwan? I help run the New School for Leadership in Healthcare which is located at the Koo Foundation Sun Yat-Sen Cancer Center. The New School is a two-year training program that takes mid-career professionals in healthcare fields (e.g. medicine, industry, government, academia) and teaches them to understand all aspects of health systems from understanding healthcare management, to improving healthcare quality, to imagining the future of healthcare. The goal is to ultimately train the next Minister of Health or the next leader of a health system, large or small, from community clinics to global institutes. We equip our scholars to manage healthcare crises and improve healthcare delivery, quality, and value. I am a co-author on the JAMA paper that raised Taiwan&rsquo;s profile to the international community for its excellent COVID-19 response: I continue to be on the lookout for interesting healthcare startups and folks who are thinking critically about health policy reform. Michael Bowcutt, Science &amp; Technology Background: USA Citizen, Mechanical Engineering Degree (Turned Software Engineering), Served a Mission for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints from 2011-2013 in Taiwan, Fluent in Chinese, Married to USA Citizen (Also fluent in Chinese) with 3 little boys (3, 2, and 9 months, they also speak Chinese!) Why Taiwan?: Taiwan was already a second home to me. The company I work with wanted to establish an Asia Area Office, and Taiwan was the perfect location from a geological, linguistic, and technological standpoint. The Gold Card was one additional benefit that Taiwan offered. What are you currently doing in Taiwan? I am currently working for Romaric Corp as the Asia Area Manager. We provide world-class automated Material Control Systems in Factories, warehousing structures, and other industries seeking full automation. I am also open to collaborating/assisting in other projects in Taiwan as requested. Tom Fifield, Science and Technology Background: I am an expert in distributed systems (got my start in famous particle physics experiments) and used to manage one of the largest Open Source user communities in the world. Why Taiwan?: In a previous job, Taipei was the Asia-Pacific regional center. I was coming here a lot for conferences, built up a friendship network, got to know the daily life and had a strong feeling that I could live here. When I got a job where I could choose to live anywhere in the world, I moved and haven&rsquo;t looked back! What are you currently doing in Taiwan? I run a small management and IT consulting company with clients in a variety of industries around the world. I was recently approved for Taiwanese citizenship! Zachary Hwang, Science and Technology Background: University of Michigan - B.S. Mechanical Engineering and Masters in Technology Commercialization Why Taiwan?: I wanted to learn Chinese which I realized was an important language in international business, particularly in China-Africa relations. Additionally, I wanted a more drastic change-up from my regular life and job in America and do something a little crazier, like traveling and getting back into startups. The low cost of living and tech ecosystem in Taiwan was very attractive towards this dream. What are you currently doing in Taiwan? I&rsquo;m currently teaching kids about technology at Skyrock Projects. We work on coding, robotics, and maker skills! Within my 3 years of having the Gold Card visa, I want to establish an energy technology startup company, develop key resources and partners in Taiwan, and then commercialize the technology to Africa. Colum Brolly, Science and Technology Background: Seasoned professional in software engineering from Ireland. I have a Bachelor&rsquo;s Degree in Computer Science from Ulster University. Worked on major systems within the aviation industry. Why Taiwan?: Having worked in the aviation industry with airlines and airports around the world I discovered Taiwan through business. I visited this wonderful island and really enjoyed my time and could see myself living here. The announcement came out in February 2018 that the Gold Card program had launched, I decided to apply soon after the launch. Once approved I then relocated to Taiwan and have been happily living here since. What are you currently doing in Taiwan? I work for a company called TPIsoftware primarily on financial software for the major banks. I am also doing global business development to take on more projects from customers globally.
