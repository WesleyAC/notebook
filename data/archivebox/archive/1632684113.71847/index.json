                    "\n                    \n                    Warning. You are about to read a bit of a rant: if you haven\u2019t already stopped reading already that is. It\u2019s been a long time in coming, but I feel I have to say something about it.\nI loathe content.\nThe word \u201ccontent\u201d that is.\nI really, really loathe it.\nIt\u2019s a hideous and yet all encompassing word.\nAt first it was just the by now omnipresent \u201cUser Generated Content\u201d. But now websites are filled with \u201ccontent\u201d. TV schedules are now packed with \u201ccontent\u201d. Radio stations use \u201ccontent\u201d to fill the airtime. Newspapers and magazine are stuffed with \u201ccontent\u201d. It\u2019s everywhere.\nLike many words, it started out as an industry specific word. Marketing types would talk about the content they were producing for their new project. That was frustrating, but marketing is full of nonsense (apologies for causing offence to any marketing professionals reading this \u2013 but you know I\u2019m speaking the truth). Yet slowly it\u2019s become one of those words that\u2019s seeped out of the confines of the marketing universe and has begun to permeate society. \u201cPremium\u201d is a word that has similarly escaped the clutches of the marketing world and broken free into our world. We all now know that a \u201cpremium lager\u201d is somehow better than a regular one. The ads are glossier; the image more refined; and the product more expensive. But it\u2019s brewed in the same facility in South Wales or wherever. Nobody can actually really explain what\u2019s so \u201cpremium\u201d about it. They might say that they like it more, but advertising has largely conditioned them to do so. And there are plenty of other examples.\nThus you\u2019ll now see consumer-facing websites talking about \u201ccontent\u201d quite openly \u2013 especially if you\u2019re invited to upload pictures, audio or video. But you\u2019ll also hear the word spoken and used in this sense on television and radio.\nContent, I\u2019m reliably informed, is from the Latin, contentum, the neuter past particple of continere meaning \u201cto contain\u201d. Google cites something like 1.4bn mentions of the word.\nDictionary.com\u2019s definition is probably as good as any:\n4. substantive information or creative material viewed in contrast to its actual or potential manner of presentation: publishers, record companies, and other content providers; a flashy Web site, but without much content.\n(I\u2019d use the OED\u2019s defintion, but it\u2019s all behind a paywall).\nSo why do I hate the word? It\u2019s a word that\u2019s not easily replaceable in the context in which it\u2019s currently used, because it can mean so many things: video, audio, written pieces, or combinations thereof. As a catchall, then, does it not serve a purpose?\nYet that\u2019s precisely what really annoys me about the word.\nIt takes that art out of those things. If I\u2019m writing an essay on a subject, is this a carefully crafted literary piece or is it a piece of \u201ccontent\u201d? If I\u2019m composing a new song, am I just making some \u201ccontent\u201d? If I\u2019m making a film with a crew, and some actors, have I really just put together \u201ccontent\u201d?\nIn the context of the word\u2019s definition, then yes I have. But the word is somehow dismissive. It doesn\u2019t consider the thought, time, or creativity (or lack of) that went into producing the work or works. Barbie Girl by Aqua and A Day In The Life by The Beatles are somehow equal because they\u2019re both just \u201ccontent\u201d. Saw VI and Lawrence of Arabia are the same. A throw away piece of tittle-tattle from The Sun\u2019s Bizarre column is the same as a 1500 word essay in the Times Literary Supplement. It\u2019s all \u201ccontent\u201d.\nIt probably doesn\u2019t help that the word sounds a little like \u201ccement\u201d, because when I hear someone talk about content \u2013 perhaps on a website \u2013 then I think about someone trying to shovel oozing piles of something into the website so that it\u2019ll quickly set and there\u2019s something there for people to read, watch or listen to. It\u2019s not a stunning piece of hand crafted masonry. It\u2019s a breeze block. There\u2019s no real thought about the quality of what\u2019s being uploaded or written; just the knowledge that some of it\u2019s needed to attract readers, viewers or listeners. There is space or airtime to fill, and on the internet, that space is effectively infinite, while in the broadcasting world you can always start a new channel or stream.\nIt\u2019s simple economics. And of course that\u2019s what the media industry is all about. With the exception (perhaps!) of the BBC, all that filler material is just there to turn a buck for the company who has to fill it.  That\u2019s fine. We live in a capitalist world. But surely we care about how we fill those empty spaces? And that to me is the problem with the word \u201ccontent.\u201d It suggests an attitude that just requires taking the most cost effective way to fill in the gaps.\nAm I an idealist? I\u2019m well aware that commissioning editors for daytime TV are just trying to fill the gaps in their schedule as cost effectively as possible. They need a decent audience share to maintain their positions, and reap the maximum value of the associated advertising.\nTo take an easy example, nobody really hand-crafts an episode of the Jeremy Kyle Show. They don\u2019t care. They just know that the network wants x hours of shows a year, and they just churn them out as quickly and cost-effectively as possible. Think of that cement mixer again, pulling up at a studio in Manchester and just dumping its load.\nSimilarly, the producers of Big Brother and Channel 4 know that they have to produce hours of footage to fill out much of Quarter Two and Three\u2019s primetime schedule. Yes, they want to maximise the audience \u2013 but that\u2019s not really the same as caring about the programmes they make. Perhaps in these instances \u201ccontent\u201d is, then, an accurate word.\nCloser to home, commercial radio has to achieve maximum revenues for minimal costs. It does this largely by playing music; in many cases, the same music. The listener is left with soundalike stations across the country. Indeed they\u2019re now quite likely to be 100% identical.\nBut does that mean that we shouldn\u2019t at least aspire to greater things?\nThe reality is that some standards have to be maintained if you want to stand out and make an impact. However dire some of ITV\u2019s comedy and drama series might be, I don\u2019t believe the makers didn\u2019t really care at least a little bit about them (OK \u2013 the producers of The Palace last year probably didn\u2019t).\nThat\u2019s not to say that slick machines can\u2019t operate, producing television programmes by the mile, but maintaining a certain quality threshold. The CSI franchise springs to mind with some excellent production values maintained, even if a few scripts do seem to have jumped the shark. House is now in its sixth series, having made well over 100 episodes, yet the quality of scripts remains impressive. It can be done.\nI suppose I get upset when I hear people throwing the word \u201ccontent\u201d around as though people will come flocking to read, listen or view it, irrespective of what it is. Pile it high and they will come!\nAnd so, every website in the known universe has rushed to include \u201cUser Generated Content\u201d in their sites! Sometimes it\u2019s very appropriate \u2013 Flickr obviously wouldn\u2019t exist without its users photos, although YouTube could probably do with a little more user generated \u201ccontent\u201d, and less broadcaster created \u201ccontent\u201d. But mostly it\u2019s just another bandwagon that most have failed to climb on.\nWhat I do agree with is that we need a word to use to talk about all this material; preferably a word that doesn\u2019t conjour up an image of a builder shoveling cement from a wheelbarrow into a hole to fill it up. Because that\u2019s what I picture in my mind\u2019s eye when I hear someone discussing how they need content to fill a hole in their schedule/pages/site. Cement is readily available in vast quantities from your local builders\u2019 yard.\nPlease give me an alternative; a word that conveys some care and consideration has gone into what has been created. And in the meantime, feel free to tell me off if I ever use the word.\nThe usual disclaimer \u2013 these are my personal opinions and do not represent those of my employer. And yes, I have, in extremis, used \u201ccontent\u201d before, quite probably on this very blog. But I try not to. I really do.\n                    \n                    \n                    \n                    \n                    \n                "
