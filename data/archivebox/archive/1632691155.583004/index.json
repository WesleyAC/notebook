Sibylla, a single mother, brings Ludo up somewhat unusually; he starts reading at two, reading Homer in the original Greek at three, and goes on to Hebrew, Japanese, Old Norse, Inuit, and advanced mathematics. To stand in for a male influence in his upbringing, Sibylla plays him Akira Kurosawa's S\n  \n  ...more\n\n          \n        \n\n\n      \n\n  \n\n  \n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n    \n\n\n        \n            \nImagine the written version of an orchestral suite, different instruments taking their turns cutting in and out, challenging, responding, developing themes, repeating themes, breaking off for a little bit of opera here, a little pas-de-deux there with a couple of guest solos thrown in, while nevertheless returning continually to the main theme and finally leading into a very fitting coda. That\u2019s what reading this book was like for me. Books like The Last Samurai don\u2019t come my way very often whic\n  \n  ...more\n\n          \n        \n\n\n      \n\n  \n\n  \n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n    \n\n\n        \n            \nSomeone\u2019s mother once said \u201cIf you don\u2019t have anything nice to say, don\u2019t say anything at all.\u201d Well, I was never one to take unsolicited advice. I think many reviewers are afraid of appearing shallow by stating the truth: THIS BOOK IS SIMPLY AWFUL. I quit at page 196. It\u2019s probably been a decade since I haven\u2019t finished a book \u2013 I think it was Crossing to Safety by Wallace Stegner. Actually, I am now remembering quitting From Hell by Alan Moore more recently.Dewitt's book rambles on and on, ski\n  \n  ...more\n\n          \n        \n\n\n      \n\n  \n\n  \n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n    \n\n\n        \n            \n Infatuation The Last Samurai is a book where you\u2019re never quite sure where you\u2019re going next and at what speed, you just realise it\u2019s going to be unconventional. To make sure you remain connected to the short snappy pointed tone of the main characters the writing adopts a similar style. Ludo is a 6-year-old language and literary genius and his mother Sibylla is also intellectually gifted. I mean seriously gifted, where they home-study mathematics, science, literature, and multiple languages inc\n  \n  ...more\n\n          \n        \n\n\n      \n\n  \n\n  \n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n    \n\n\n        \n            \nin this case, and for no special reason, I\u2019d really like to write the kind of thing which is frequently called a real review. For this book, The Last Samurai. Rather than be :; a) clever (succeed or fail, no matter) b) auto-bio-graphical (in however obtuse a manner) c) pretentiously name=dropping or d) just generally tapping dancing and bowing. I doubt it\u2019ll happen. But just in case I\u2019m going to start reviewing The Last Samurai right now while I\u2019ve still got a third of the novel to read, remaini\n  \n  ...more\n\n          \n        \n\n\n      \n\n  \n\n  \n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n    \n\n\n        \n            \nThere is a LOT in this book. I don't know where to start.What Shall I do? I need to write a review, especially after the last quote I put up which is throughly insufficient to describe The Last Samurai.  What shall I DO?I'm stuck in a rut myself. I've been doing this for too long. I keep telling myself I should bite the bullet... and make a comeback. What's the use of spending my life in this room? What's the use of me sitting in front of this blank screen trying to achieve some undefined ideal \n  \n  ...more\n\n          \n        \n\n\n      \n\n  \n\n  \n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n    \n\n\n        \n            \nThere's some heart in this novella after all. I'm skipping the pithy quotations to give it to you straight. Here are a few things:I sometimes feel depressed too. In my line of work, I often come across people who feel depressed. And I think, well, I have no degree in psychology. I'm certainly not qualified. But then I also think, what the hell? Sometimes people just simply need to know that someone is listening. So I try to listen. But I'm not always so good at getting people to talk.

But finding the time for that has proved difficult. And while I think the film is important for a full appreciation of The Last Samurai, the novel does provide enough context for it to be understood alone.The novel itself is an original, highly innovative work, making bold and unexpected decisions in te\n  \n  ...more\n\n          \n        \n\n\n      \n\n  \n\n  \n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n    \n\n\n        \n            \nAt first sight this is dazzlingly erudite but almost immediately DeWitt undercuts the intellectualism: with wit, with acuity, she navigates a story which both valorises knowledge and intellectual pursuits but also recognises the limitations of pure mind when it comes to living what philosophers term 'a good life'. This is a book which zooms between disciplines: music, maths, literature, language all play important parts - and we should note the character's names: Sybilla and Ludo, because there'\n  \n  ...more\n\n          \n        \n\n\n      \n\n  \n\n  \n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n    \n\n\n        \n            \nThis is the type of book I would have adored a decade ago, back when I was obsessing over Chabon and Foer and Eggers and the other at-the-time literary fiction elite that I was rapidly consuming. And it, today, was still an enjoyable read, but the overall impact is just a bit too precociously twee to really hit the pleasure centers of my brain that it once would have directly impacted.

I don't know is how time will affect my opinion of it, but I think it could last.It's a novel about the normal and the eccentric, about learning, about languages, music, art, and Kurosawa. It's about the shape of brilliance. It doesn't sacrifice philosophy or intellectualism for narrative power or vice versa. Each smaller narrative wound into the whole is like story-candy.

It's easy to get off of \"death of this-or-that\" re fiction, or really any art form, because art of course moves quickly. After writing that screed I just wrote about Palahniuk, I for a moment felt disillusioned with the state of the contemporary novel.

Although she has included a number of beautifully executed short stories in her novel...generally to introduce minor characters who are, nevertheless, central to the overall theme...her general writing style alternates between annoying sputters of words written in staccato--as if sent via telegram to the reader--and long, drawn out passages of sometimes obscure wr\n  \n  ...more\n\n          \n        \n\n\n      \n\n  \n    \n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n    \n\n\n        \n            \nFor the first half of this book, I was in love and ready to marry it, but at about the halfway point when there is a shift of perspective from mother to son, I decided we were better as just good friends. The gorgeous writing never falters, but the plot eventually becomes a bit repetitive. At times the fitting of the narrative into the structure that Dewitt has created can feel forced. It's as if the structure gets in the way of the narrative.

Yet, Foer's book was much better and made much more sense than this one. The Last Samurai starts off in a great way, I especially liked the Japanese parts, since I'm a learner of Japanese and all. However, the second part of the book has many ramblings that don't make any sense sometimes. It's like it could be a great book, yet it lost something along the way and became more of a medio\n  \n  ...more\n\n          \n        \n\n\n      \n\n  \n\n  \n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n    \n\n\n        \n            \nThe Last Samurai by Helen DeWittHands down this is one of the best novels I have read in several years. Helen DeWitt has written a tour de force, a brilliant, funny, sometimes tragic tale about a single mother and her precocious young son , Ludo, whom she also endearingly calls The Phenomenon.The Last Samurai follows the education and adventures of Ludo. His mother Sibylla meagerly supports the both, typing out copy for popular hobby magazines of mostly obscure pursuits.

It was one of those \"Oh, I'll be able to breeze through this and return it to you so you can read it\" kinds of things. Considering that was years ago, clearly I didn't do breeze through it or return it. Hey, it's part of my charm.This wasn't an easy book to get into.

Think a highbrow Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close. It is funny and fast-paced, although with diminishing returns as it plods towards its end, with the wan energy of an author tired of her subject but committed to finishing the damn book. But what put me off were the constant moments of showboating - two Oxford degrees in Classics are constantly thrust in your face, with the author's use of Greek, Icelandic or Ar\n  \n  ...more\n\n          \n        \n\n\n      \n\n  \n\n  \n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n    \n\n\n        \n            \nIf you like Haruki Murakami, you will like this book more.

It just happened to be that I was thinking of a different aspect of The Last Samurai every time the question was posed. And it was that given aspect that I felt to be the most germane, the most salient to the novel at the moment.
