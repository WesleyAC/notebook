		(2022/02/19) making a <a href="https://www.are.na/wesleyac/defunct-blogging-platforms">list of defunct blogging platforms</a>, and it's really interesting to see the different ways websites die. domain parking pages, timeouts, infinite redirect loops, straight-up blank pages, redirects to acquirers, blog posts announcing the shutdown, landing pages for the startup that bought the domain years ago and then never launched, https certs with long-deprecated cipher suites, and dozens of others.

		(2022/02/09) i've been trying to use are.na more, recently. i finally put the <a href="https://www.are.na/wesleyac/wesleypill-reading-list">wesleypill reading list</a> online after having it live in a text file for a while, and i'm organizing my thoughts about a <a href="https://www.are.na/wesleyac/social-medium-lvdx3kayz6e">new social medium</a>. anyway, it still feels a little lonely, so if you're an are.na person feel free to make a private channel with me and let's trade some interesting blocks :)

		(2022/02/03) i started reading ursula k le guin's translation of the tao te ching a few days ago. here's a good quote from her "idiosyncratic and unscholarly" notes:

		<blockquote>
			Heaven and earth — that is, "Nature" and its Way — are not humane, because they are not human. They are not kind; they are not cruel: those are human attributes. You can only be kind or cruel if you have, and cherish, a self. You can't even be indifferent if you aren't different. Altruism is the other side of egoism. Followers of the Way, like the forces of nature, act selflessly.
		</blockquote>
