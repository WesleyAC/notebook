offhandedly mentions the Six State Council coming together to form their own govenrment. i ask if the nation-state of California is part of it, but no, they\u2019re part of the separate \u201cWest Coast Pact\u201dreality is a bad sci-fi novel, but hey, at least i\u2019ll get to see the collapse of the american empire within my life \u00af_(\u30c4)_/\u00af\n\n\n\nApr 12, 2020\u202f\u2014\u202f22:56\n#\n\nstarting to think that a lot of liberals really hate the idea of trump, but not like, any specific thing that he\u2019s done\n\n\n\nApr 12, 2020\u202f\u2014\u202f19:24\n#\n\nmy crappy but convenient earbuds broke, so now i\u2019m using my nice but sort of annoying headphones, and wow does everything sound so much nicer\n\n\n\nApr 10, 2020\u202f\u2014\u202f14:03\n#\n\nstarting to get a little annoyed at my sleep schedule - it sucks to wake up and have no idea what time it is.\n\n\nApr 09, 2020\u202f\u2014\u202f11:17\n#\n\nthere\u2019s something special about writing a proxy - at first, it just works and is completely magical, and then you can start dipping your toes into the stream of bits going past, mucking with things here and there and seeing what changes, slowly understanding the structure of the protocol going past you. it\u2019s a good way to understand a system.\n\n\n\n\nApr 09, 2020\u202f\u2014\u202f02:22\n#\n\ngotta love finding a library that \u201cparses varints,\u201d does not specify what type of varint it parses, and lists as example applications, three different protocols which all use slightly different varint specifications\u2026\n\n\n\nApr 08, 2020\u202f\u2014\u202f23:29\n#\n\nstarted watching the most recent Well There\u2019s Your Problem, and getting really frustrated at how bad leftists can be at\u2026 not being wrong about things. there\u2019s this whole generation of Chapo Trap House/Mike Gravel/Well There\u2019s Your Problem style leftism that seems to be pretty effective drawing people in, but does so by just lying and/or not bothering to research anything and just assuming all facts line up with their worldview, and it\u2019s just really frustrating to me :/you don\u2019t need to make shit up to convince people of leftist ideas, the truth works well enough for that.\n\n\nApr 08, 2020\u202f\u2014\u202f02:40\n#\n\nhaving lots of thoughts about how credentialism relates to the current covid-19 situation. i still don\u2019t believe in credentialism, but i do believe that it doesn\u2019t make sense to trust inexperienced people. it\u2019s hard to communicate that distinction, though, especially given the nebulousness of what counts as \u201cexperience\u201di think it\u2019s somehow tied in my mind to the sre org at goog, and how that was so full of people who had taken weird paths to get where they ended up, and were really great at their jobs because of it. i\u2019m sad that that\u2019s not something we see in other fields much, especially given the value that i think there is in applying the sre skillset to other domains.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
