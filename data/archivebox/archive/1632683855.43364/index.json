                    "Emigration and other hedges\n\nWhen my partner and I moved to Taiwan in March, many of our friends were quite surprised.\nBack then, all I wrote was: \u201clong pandemic story short, ended up in Taiwan\u201d.\n\nToday I want to share that story in more detail, for two reasons:\n\n\nTo encourage you to make decisions, even (especially!) when you are uncertain about low-probability extreme outcomes.\nTo remind you that emigration may be an option to hedge against such outcomes.\n\n\nI emphatically do not mean to say that you should emigrate somewhere, nor imply that everyone even has this choice.\n(Of course not! Just like the goofy computing shit we usually discuss on this newsletter, emigration is not available to literally billions of people due to systemic political, social, and economic factors entirely outside of their control.)\n\nI\u2019m writing to you, my friend, so that if you are fortunate enough to have the option, you at least consider it.\n\nA digression on earthquakes\n\nBefore we get to emigration, let\u2019s first discuss reasoning about low-probability extreme outcomes.\n\nMy advice, in short:\n\n\nResist the urge to round small numbers down to zero,\nbecause a small number times a big number might still be very big.\n\n\nHere\u2019s an example: One day in my 20\u2019s I realized I was living on the Cascadia subduction zone, so I decided to park two weeks of non-perishable food, water, and basic medical supplies in my backyard.\n\nDid I think an earthquake was imminent?\nNo.\n\nDid I think that after an unlikely (but possible!) earthquake, I might be on my own for a while, and so might appreciate past-Kevin\u2019s bottled water and beans foresight?\nWell, yeah, I saw Katrina on television, and there\u2019s no evidence to suggest that wouldn\u2019t happen to me.\nSo, spend 0.1% of my annual income once every decade (gotta replace the beans) to hedge that risk?\nAbsolutely!\nYes!\nGood trade!\n\nThis isn\u2019t paranoia or disaster fetishism.\nI\u2019m an optimistic, happy person; I don\u2019t spend my evenings lovingly staring at a horde of gold bars and shotguns.\n\nHowever, I do appreciate a good back-of-the-envelope calculation and once heard that Black Swan Guy on a podcast.\nSo I\u2019m aware that \u201cunlikely\u201d is not the same as \u201cimpossible\u201d \u2014 and the distinction matters when the stakes are high!\n\n(Homework: If you live in an area at risk of earthquakes \u2014 e.g., anywhere along the American West coast \u2014 do you have two weeks of food and water? If not, please stop reading now and get some. Seriously, 2020 is barely halfway over. While you\u2019re up, practice closing your house/apartment\u2019s gas line too. I mean it! I don\u2019t want to hear from any of you ding dongs about \u201clocal-first software\u201d or \u201cdistributed systems\u201d until you have a local-first supply of water and carbohydrates.)\n\nSo, how did I end up in Taiwan?\n\nTo explain, let me set the scene; come back with me to the before times.\n\nEarly February 2020, I meet with a friend visiting town.\nHe asks if I\u2019m worried about this virus in Asia.\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t really spend time following the news.\u201d\nHe says no more about it.\nWe eat burritos.\n\nLate February, I\u2019m in New York City visiting friends on my way to a small conference.\nI have beers with my Instagram-famous uncle and he wonders if this virus thing might affect his travel plans.\nA woman in a fancy soap store asks if \u201cin the spirit of the times\u201d we\u2019d like to wash our hands with her wares.\nMy partner and I travel on to our conference.\n\nThe first week of March, we conference.\nThere is much discussion of technical matters, old friends, drinking, new friends, and I continue to pay no attention to the Coronavirus.\n\nSecond week of March, I\u2019m working onsite with a client in the finance industry.\nOn Monday March 9, we watch the S&P 500 trip its circuit breaker for falling too quickly immediately after trading opened.\nNow I (and seemingly everyone else in the West) start paying attention.\n\nBy Wednesday, the severity of the situation is made clear when one of the few remaining American institutions trusted by the general public acts against its short-term economic interest: The NBA stops playing basketball.\n\nI\u2019m telling you all this to set the context: I\u2019m in the middle of a one-week client engagement on a small British Overseas Territory and three days into paying any attention whatsoever to Coronavirus.\nLike everyone at the time, I have no idea how the virus will spread, its health impacts on individuals, the social and economic impacts, etc., etc.\n\nFortunately, our travel plans \u2014 a 2-day layover / vacation in Panama on our return to the US \u2014 now seem like an obviously a bad idea, so my partner and I realize we need to make alternative arrangements.\n\nHere\u2019s where reasoning about low-probability extreme events comes in.\nI, a non-expert, non-disaster-enthusiast, can imagine only two extreme scenarios to worry about:\n\n\ngetting sick (\u2018rona or otherwise) and being unable to access medical care\nsupply chain breakdown (i.e., empty grocery stores) and likely social consequences (violent theft, etc.)\n\n\nAgain, I didn\u2019t think these were likely, but I didn\u2019t think they were impossible either.\nI guesstimated the odds of Safeway closing for two weeks at 5%.\n\nGiven these two broad low-probability, high-badness concerns, that Wednesday my partner and I discussed a few possible options:\n\n\nStay put.\nThis was tempting: My client very generously offered to host us and, as you might expect from someone who works in finance from a British Overseas Territory, they have a very comfortable home.\nHowever, if international travel shut down we\u2019d be stuck on a small island.\nTourism was obviously over for at least a few months, which was not going to be great for the local economy.\nIf supply chains got cut off, we wouldn\u2019t starve (lots of fishing boats), but the rum and diesel would run out quickly.\nAs for the pandemic itself, well, the Four Seasons medical clinic I\u2019m sure has great food but, uh\u2026\nHead back immediately to Oakland (where my partner lived at the time).\nI wasn\u2019t thrilled about this option, as the San Francisco Bay Area normally feels like it\u2019s on brink of collapse.\nI\u2019ve witnessed (in broad daylight, in multiple places!) people publicly defecating (in front of police!), breaking into cars, and shooting up.\nYes, the reasons for this are complex and tragic, but that longstanding dysfunction suggested to me the Bay Area might not be the best place to be during a pandemic.\n(The anti-vaccine literature prominently displayed in every wealthy Berkeley grocery store checkout queue didn\u2019t instill confidence either.)\nHead elsewhere in the US.\nWe briefly considered this, but had no evidence to suggest that any particular family member, friend, local government or region would fare better than another.\nBesides, heading anywhere else would put us at a disadvantage in terms of the supply chain risk (my partner\u2019s beans were in Oakland).\n\n\nMore broadly, the US national response at that time was, uh, uninspiring (basketball association excepted), and I was concerned about how the population as a whole might react.\n(I suspect more Americans have guns than earthquake kits.)\n\nOn Thursday, March 12 it occurred to me that the best place to go might be in Asia, for two reasons:\n\n\nMany Asian countries already have a social norm around wearing masks in public (partly from the first SARS outbreak and partly because, well, they consider it polite not to sneeze on people).\nAsian countries were \u201cahead\u201d of the West in terms of the pandemic, so instead speculating as to how a Western government would react it was possible to see how Asian governments were reacting.\n\n\nOkay, sure, but which Asian country should we actually head to?\n\nI figured it\u2019d be better to be in a wealthier country, which ruled out places like Vietnam, Thailand, etc.\n\nHong Kong seemed to be handling the virus well, but also losing its autonomy.\nSingapore is famously well run and also famously not so free.\nJapan I\u2019d visited (and quite liked!), but they seemed to be in denial about the virus due to their hosting of 2020 Summer Olympics.\nSouth Korea I\u2019d always wanted to visit and was already testing extensively (via drive-throughs!).\n\nHowever, in my hour of Googling I found this this JAMA article which made it clear that Taiwan would be our best bet due to the extremely competent government response thus far.\n(Which I experienced firsthand when I arrived in March.)\nFor example, Taiwan began screening flights from Wuhan in December and in February the military was deployed to work in mask factories.\nAlso: The vice president (at the time, now recently returned to academia) was the epidemiologist who oversaw the health department during the 2003\u20132004 SARS outbreak.\n\nAgain, not an expert, but, uh, democratic island nation with strong ties to the US, national health insurance system, extensive domestic medical manufacturing capacity, and an epidemiologist vice president?\nYes, good place to be for a global pandemic!\n\nOn Friday March 13 we bought tickets: $700 per person from Puerto Rico to Taipei (including a no-change-fee \u201cplease god just book a flight, our industry is melting down\u201d return leg to San Francisco).\n\nOnce we realized we needed to make a decision, it was actually pretty easy because of the payoff matrix skew.\nThe potential downsides were, what?\nWe get rejected at the border and end up having wasted a flight?\nThe virus turns out to be no big deal and we feel dumb for having spent 5% of our income on an unnecessary working-vacation?\n\nThe potential upside?\nWell, lets just say that while I\u2019ve spent the last 4 months wandering freely around Taipei eating1 gua bao with my 23 million new friends, I\u2019ve also been watching all my old friends growing increasingly bad haircuts at home while trying to avoid permanent organ damage.\n\nWhy am I telling you all this?\n\nI\u2019m not sharing my story because I want to gloat.\nI\u2019m sharing my story because all the reasoning still holds.\n\nLike, there is still a pandemic!\nYou are more likely to get COVID now than you were back in March when everyone was flipping out.\nYou won\u2019t make the news anymore, but it will still be very bad for you and your family!\n\nOn the other side of the equation, how difficult is it to move to another country?\n\nClearly, that depends on your situation:\nCan you work remotely or afford to be out of work for a while?\nDo you have the literal privileges granted from the governments involved?\nEtc.\n\nIn our case, we entered Taiwan as visa-exempt American citizens.\nWe didn\u2019t plan to move permanently (we had only our conference trip duffel bags), but after a week of watching the US response it felt likely we\u2019d want to stay our full 90 days2 in Taiwan.\n\nMy partner offered her landlord upfront payment in exchange for reduced rent, but after that was declined she ended her lease and hired a freshly unemployed family-member to move everything into storage.\n(Aside from the cost-savings of not paying for an unoccupied apartment, we also figured the Bay Area rental market would be cheaper a few months into a pandemic anyway.)\n\nAfter we\u2019d finished with our two weeks of arrival \u201cself-health isolation\u201d and spent a few weeks moving freely in Taipei, we decided to explore our options for staying longer.\nThe cost of this hedge also turned out to be quite low for us: We were issued 3-year residency permits after submitting paperwork online showing we\u2019d been paid salaries of at least US$5,300/month sometime in the past three years.\n\n(Note: This \u201cGold Card\u201d program is still active and one can apply from outside of Taiwan. The government also considers studying Mandarin to be a valid reason to enter Taiwan.)\n\nI feel more comfortable describing my situation as a \u201chedge\u201d than as \u201cemigration\u201d.\nThe latter word somehow feels more permanent; more serious.\nMy mother, for example, as a teenager jumped on a fishing boat the morning after her city fell to invading communists, promptly got lost in the ocean, and was eventually rescued to America.\n\nI, on the other hand, watched three movies back-to-back and took a nap.\n\nHedging is all about balancing hard-to-know risks with (sometimes) hard-to-know costs.\nIn terms of risks, we\u2019ve mostly discussed my experience with the pandemic, but there are of course others.\n\nE.g., my fellow Americans, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve noticed our police3 erupting in violence.\nThey\u2019re pulling people into unmarked vans coast to coast.\nOur president has been calling my hometown a beehive of terrorists and speculating about delaying the election.\nIt\u2019s not exactly a \u201chealthy democracy\u201d look!\n\nNow, I\u2019m not saying you should or shouldn\u2019t emigrate, quarantine, protest, or whatever.\nI just want to remind you to actually think about low-probability events and extreme outcomes.\n\nWhat you decide to do is, of course, quite personal.\nHow can you best take care of yourself and your loved ones?\nHow should you balance your idealism with your pragmatism?\nIs it better to try to reform a government/society or contribute to one that already better reflects your values?\nVoice or Exit?\n\nHard questions, yes, but worth thinking about!\n\nAnd if I, your newsletter nerd friend, can help in any way, please reach out.\nPlease stay safe, do good, and be well.\n\nOkay, now back to dumb computer stuff.\n\nA very thin keyboard\n\nBehold, a very thin keyboard!\n\n\n\nThe joy of this project is inventing and balancing contradictory goals.\nLet\u2019s make a keyboard that\u2019s both mechanical (with keys that have a satisfying amount of travel) but also thin (so not too much travel).\nIt should be usable (easy to learn, type fast, be reliable) but also small and portable (wireless, fewer keys).\n\nThis is product design as sport.\nThe keyboard doesn\u2019t matter, just as picking up a heavy steel bar or reaching the top of a mountain doesn\u2019t matter.\nWhat matters is the struggle!\n\nLuckily, in aiming to make the thinnest possible mechanical keyboard (no thicker than the switches themselves), I\u2019ve ensured myself a sufficient supply of struggle.\nI\u2019ve had to source custom thin lithium ion cells, design protection circuitry, and select the rest of the board components to minimize leakage currents and other standby losses.\nOn the firmware side, I\u2019ve had to dive into the details of bluetooth and evaluate architectural tradeoffs between latency, battery life, and ease of use.\n\nSo far, my work has been largely theoretical \u2014 rough back of the envelope calculations based on datasheets and YouTube videos.\nBut I recently purchased an oscilloscope (an instrument for measuring voltages on the timescale of microseconds), which will let me test various assumptions about my code and hardware.\nE.g., exactly how many cycles does it take to process a keypress and go back to sleep?\n\nRough firmware has also allowed me to test actually using the keyboard.\n(Yes, it works!)\nAfter just a few minutes, several industrial design issues became apparent.\n\nThe first you probably already noticed: The USB charging cable\u2019s rubber strain relief lifts keyboard off the table.\nI\u2019d anticipated this when I specified the mid-mount connector, and decided I\u2019d figure it out later.\nWell, later is now!\nI can think of a few possible solutions:\n\n\nIgnore it; after all, the cable is only needed for charging, so if the battery lasts sufficiently long it\u2019s not a big deal.\nDesign an enclosure so that the circuit board is lifted up the extra millimeter or two. Ugh, not sporting!\nShave down the cable thickness. Practical!\nDrop the USB connector entirely and use wireless charging. Hmmmm\u2026\n\n\nIt\u2019s really small too!\n\n\n\nThe other issue that became immediately apparent once I started using the keyboard is, uh, the number of keys: 5x5.\nThis is many fewer keys than a normal keyboard.\n\nAgain, the constraint here was chosen primarily for sport (also because, if I recall correctly, it cost an extra $10 for PCBs larger than 100mm square).\n\nThe design tradeoff here is between usability and size.\n\nPerhaps the easiest keyboard to learn would have a one-to-one mapping between keys and characters, but such a keyboard would be quite large.\nAt the opposite extreme, perhaps the smallest, most portable keyboard would be a wireless telegraph key, which would both require a lot of training (learn Morse code!) but also have a low typing speed ceiling.\n\nChorded keyboards like stenotypes have fewer keys than a normal computer keyboard and rely on operators to press multiple keys simultaneously.\nThe current world typing record (360 words per minute) is on such a machine.\n\nTraditional keyboards reduce number of physical keys needed by moving symbols and uppercase letters to a separate \u201clayer\u201d that\u2019s accessed via the \u201cshift\u201d key.\nBut there\u2019s nothing special about one layer; in the case of a 5x5 keyboard it might make more sense to have a \u201cnumber layer\u201d, \u201csymbol layer\u201d, \u201cfunction layer\u201d (volume and brightness controls), etc.\n\nOther techniques I\u2019ve seen explored include combining layer keys with regular characters (e.g., the spacebar might act as the \u201ccontrol\u201d key if you hold it down and press another key; otherwise if you just press down and up it acts as a regular spacebar).\n\nKeys are boring anyway\n\nWhy pigeonhole ourselves with keyboards, devices that map button presses into \u201ckeys\u201d?\nArguably more fun devices include soundboards (which map button presses into silly noises), stream decks (selecting between camera angles and Twitch culture things I\u2019m too old to understand), video game controllers, etc.\n\nThe interface of virtual key codes isn\u2019t one we necessarily have to support.\nWhy not instead something contextual, where physical keys are mapped directly to operations in the currently focused program?\nWe\u2019ve talked about window managers previously; perhaps a 5x5 grid of buttons to could select and move windows around a 5x5 grid on your desktop?\n\nThin client updates\n\nLast month I hypothesized that maybe, just maybe, being able to ping Google\u2019s Taipei datacenter in 3 milliseconds would mean I could use their computers for my computing needs, rather than buying my own desktop hardware.\n\nI realized there are two distinct sub-problems here:\n\n\nWhat local hardware is required to hook up my monitor, keyboard, and trackpad to The Cloud?\nWhat \u201cremote desktop\u201d software doesn\u2019t have an infuriating amount of latency?\n\n\nI decided to table the first problem for now, since it\u2019s only worth figuring once after low-latency remoting works from my current local hardware (i.e., my laptop).\n\nAs for the second problem: Five of you emailed to extol the virtues of Mosh, the \u201cmobile shell\u201d.\nBut, as I said last time, there\u2019s more to life than text: I\u2019m aiming to do graphical computing on the remote.\n(Fancy stuff, like reading PDFs.)\n\nI\u2019m adamant that anything short of a full graphical environment is a leaky abstraction that will inevitably lead to madness.\n(Shout out to the sixth newsletter reader who emailed about Mosh to say it was \u201ca nightmare for clipboard management\u201d.)\n\nAnyway, I tried out more remote desktop software.\nThe current lead contender is No Machine, a proprietary solution with a generous free version.\nIn addition to being the most functional software I\u2019ve tried thus far (I can watch YouTube on the remote!), happily several factors suggest it\u2019s worth trusting:\n\n\nIt\u2019s commercial \u2014 i.e., it\u2019s someone\u2019s actual job to keep it working (unlike open source).\nThe business model is clear: They charge $$$ for enterprise features.\nThe Lindy effect suggests it\u2019ll stick around (webpage copyright since 2002).\nTheir landing page is boring.\n\n\nThat said, there is still a noticeable latency \u2014 my best guess is that it\u2019s caused by software video encoding on the server side.\nI\u2019d like to test this hypothesis (and also Parsec, a videogame-oriented remote desktop solution with a VC-alarm-bell suspiciously fun landing page), but unfortunately Google refuses to rent me a GPU due to my lack of billing history.\nApparently the Cloud part of Google isn\u2019t connected to the AdSense part, where my account has spent thousands. \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af\n\nWe\u2019ll find out next month whether a timely payment of my $1.72 bill sufficiently establishes my credibility to rent a GPU.\n\nWorks in progress\n\n(I already keep a list of open interests, but thought it\u2019d be worth mentioning here what I\u2019m actively exploring in case any of y'all have suggestions or collaboration interest.)\n\nRemotely controlled remote control: My apartment has mini-split air conditioners, controlled via an infrared remote.\nI turn them off when leaving the house, but it\u2019d be nice to turn them back on remotely (e.g., when I am returning from lunch and would like to arrive to an optimal-napping-temperature bedroom).\nI\u2019ll design my own IR transmitter using the same bluetooth microcontrollers I used in the keyboard \u2014 but how should I access those remotely?\nShould I run some kind of open source IoT pile of code on a Raspberry Pi and, uh, exposed that to the Internet?\nShould I roll my own thing using a VPN or the Patch Bay?\nIf I wanted to sell this hardware as a product to other nerds, what functionality would they be willing to pay for?\n(\u201cIR Blaster\u201d is the term of art here, and a quick Amazon search shows many existing offerings between $30\u2013150.)\n\nMicrocontroller superoptimization:\nThere\u2019s a direct relationship between my keyboard\u2019s firmware efficiency and its battery life.\nThis got me wondering about how programming languages usually force me to over-specify my intent and thus prevent certain optimizations.\nE.g., I can\u2019t say \u201cread registers A, B, C into D, E, F\u201d without specifying an order in my source code.\nThe compiler must respect that order, even if I don\u2019t actually care about it and reading in some other order might be faster4.\n\nThe Bloom language explored these ideas in a distributed systems context, but I\u2019m not aware of any close-to-the-machine embedded language work.\n\nMore broadly, I\u2019ve been struggling with doing compile-time calculations in Rust.\nThe macro system and const fns are complex yet deliberately limited; the sorts of calculations I\u2019m trying to run (integer division to choose clock prescalers; assert-at-compile-time arithmetic relationships between constants) always end up being \u201cpuzzles\u201d.\nMy solution thus far \u2014 do it in a spreadsheet and copy into the source code magic numbers with comments \u2014 is unsatisfying in the same way that using the back of a screwdriver as a hammer is both expedient yet feels deeply wrong.\n(Zig\u2019s approach to compile-time looks much more interesting and cohesive.)\n\nIn the embedded domain, such needs seem to be addressed by increasingly complex \u201cbuild tools\u201d (compiler preprocessor macros, make targets, etc.), but I can\u2019t help but wonder what a more deliberately designed system might look like\nThere\u2019s a lot of interesting work to draw from staged languages, program synthesis, refinement types, superoptimizers, and solver-aided programming.\n\nI won\u2019t write a programming language, I won\u2019t write a programming language, I won\u2019t write\u2026\n\nMisc. Stuff\n\n\nClojure has been the most influential single work on my personal technical growth, and it\u2019s fascinating to read Rich Hickey\u2019s reflection and history on the language. Thanks Rich!\nA Lego submarine.\n\u201cWhen this pandemic is \u201cover\u201d (whatever that means), the undead bones of neoliberal governance may well yet again gather themselves from the chaos and reconstitute the suave, smooth-talking vampire to whose predations we have grown unhappily accustomed. But they may not. We may find ourselves in a period of social experimentation and change. If so, as we diminish (not eliminate!) the role of markets, it is useful I think to understand the variety of functions that markets serve, so that framers of new institutions understand what will be excised, what may sometimes need to be replaced. So. Here are four functions of markets.\u201d\nWe should all aspire to have a dentist who\u2019ll x-ray our circuit boards.\nUX analysis of pockets (and pants prototyping!) \nThe surest way to a fast web site: a public dashboard so developers feel bad when they make a slow web site.\n\u201cYou\u2019ll never get in that package without a pair of scissors, so don\u2019t even try.\u201d\nShamir\u2019s secret sharing scheme.\nTheory: Prevent others from reading your embedded device firmware by setting this non-volatile lock register. Practice: How can the CPU know it\u2019s locked if we kick it when it tries to read that register?\n\u201cIf we were feeling snarky, we could perhaps describe IPv6 as the String Theory of networking: a decades-long boondoggle that attracts True Believers, gets you flamed intensely if you question the doctrine, and which is notable mainly for how much progress it has held back.\u201d\nIntroduction to compressed sensing, with examples in Python.\n\u201cWe all know what it signifies but not exactly what it means\u2014and that was the intent.\u201d A history of the biohazard symbol.\nBitcoin is more like ham radio than the early internet.\nElectric unicycles now go 45 mph.\nSeeking truth in a time of misinformation.\nHigh-performance brain-to-text communication via imagined handwriting.\nDo you have two weeks of non-perishable food and water?\n\n\n\n"
