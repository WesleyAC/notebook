<h1>webmention-receiver</h1>


<p>This is a <a href="https://github.com/wesleyac/webmention-receiver">webmention-receiver</a> server. It allows anyone to receive notifications when someone links to their website via <a href="https://indieweb.org/Webmention">webmentions</a>, without needing to create an account.</p>

<p>To use it, add this HTML to the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> section of the pages you want to receive mentions for:</p>

<p>
</p><pre>&lt;link href="https://webmention.wesleyac.com/example.com/receiver" rel="webmention" /&gt;
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>Replacing <code>example.com</code> with the domain your website is on.</p>

<p>Once you've done that, you'll be able to see webmentions that people send you by visiting <code>https://webmention.wesleyac.com/example.com</code>. You can subscribe to updates using RSS at <code>https://webmention.wesleyac.com/example.com/feed.xml</code></p>

<p>If you would like to also receive <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pingback">pingbacks</a>, you can use <a href="https://webmention.io/">webmention.io</a> to convert them to webmentions (also without creating an account), by adding the following line to your <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>:</p>

<p>
</p><pre>&lt;link href="https://webmention.io/webmention?forward=https://webmention.wesleyac.com/example.com/receiver" rel="pingback" /&gt;
</pre>
<p>

</p><p>(Replacing <code>example.com</code> with your domain, once again)</p>

<p>webmention-receiver currently does not attempt to verify that the source or target pages exist. If I end up running into spam problems, I'll go and implement that.</p>
