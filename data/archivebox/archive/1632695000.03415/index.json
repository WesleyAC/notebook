                    "Billions of dollars were earmarked to support nuclear operations in New Mexico in the Fiscal Year 2021 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA).U.S Sen. Martin Heinrich (D-NM) said he worked to secure funding in the Act for the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) and the state\u2019s two national laboratories: Los Alamos and Sandia, along with other provisions in support of New Mexico facilities such as Spaceport America and White Sands Missile Range.The Senate Armed Services Committee advanced the legislation this week on a 25-2 bipartisan vote, read a news release from Heinrich\u2019s office, adopting 229 amendments.Support local journalism. Subscribe to the Carlsbad Current-Argus.The bill now heads to the Senate Floor for a vote.\u201cDuring my time in the Senate, I have been proud to secure significant increases in the budgets for both Los Alamos and Sandia, growing each by more than 2,000 employees,\u201d Heinrich said.\u201cI have also remained steadfast in my efforts to call on the Department of Energy and WIPP to work collaboratively with the State of New Mexico and the Carlsbad community to maintain the public\u2019s confidence and ensure that WIPP maintains the highest levels of safety and transparency.\"More:WIPP monitoring center's funding renewed for five yearsHe said much of the bill\u2019s provisions related to New Mexico would support its military and defense installations which create jobs and revenue for the state.\u201cNew Mexico is the center of excellence for small satellites and for directed energy weapons, and this bill increases funding and streamlines authorities to bolster those missions,\u201d Heinrich said. \u201cThese provisions, among many others, benefit New Mexico\u2019s economy, and advance New Mexico's steadfast position as a leader in national security for years to come.\u201dCommittee Chairman U.S. Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.) said the bill enjoyed bipartisan support with input from both parties.More:WIPP expansion needed for proposed disposal of surplus plutonium at nuclear waste repository\u201cThis year marks the 60th year in a row that the Committee has fulfilled our Constitutional duty to provide for the common defense by advancing the National Defense Authorization Act \u2014 once again with overwhelming support,\u201d Inhofe said.\u201cThere\u2019s a reason for this: It\u2019s because this bill is, to its core, bipartisan, reflecting equal input from Republicans and Democrats alike.\u201dRanking member U.S. Sen. Jack Reed (D-RI) touted a section of the bill that offered a pay raise for members of the military, while also providing support for their families.More:WIPP facility near Carlsbad ideal for plutonium disposal, federal regulators say\u201cThis bipartisan NDAA is a needed step toward strengthening national security and prioritizing national defense resources,\u201d Reed said. \u201cIt provides our troops with a well-deserved pay raise and tools to protect the health and well-being of our forces and their families.\u201dHere are the main provisions in support of WIPP and New Mexico\u2019s national laboratories.Waste Isolation Pilot Plant gets funds for operations, infrastructureThe NDAA authorized $390 million for operations at WIPP, including support for disposal operations, regulatory and environment compliance operations and waste characterization and transportation.More:WIPP utility shaft project challenged as illegalThe money would also go toward continued progress on replacing and updating infrastructure including $50 million toward a $100 million project to build a new utility shaft at the facility as part of an almost $400 million rebuild of WIPP\u2019s ventilation system to increase airflow in the underground.Another $22 million would go\u00a0to repair and replacing aging infrastructure, and the bill would fund WIPP\u2019s transition to using low emission diesel equipment at the facility.Air quality at WIPP became a concern as officials worked to allow mining and waste emplacement operations to occur simultaneously as Panel 7 was filled in Panel 8 was mined.More:WIPP: COVID-19 outbreak leads to reduction in nuclear waste operations near CarlsbadNational Laboratories get billionsThe bill authorizes $2.6 billion for operations at Sandia National Laboratories in Fiscal Year 2021, an increase of $330 million from FY 2020.Another $3.2 billion was earmarked for Los Alamos National Laboratories (LANL), up almost $1 billion from FY 2020\u2019s funding of $2.3 billion.More:Billions in federal funds coming to New Mexico's nuclear sites, military basesLos Alamos National Laboratory continues cleanup efforts, nuclear researchA provision was added to the bill to fully fund LANL\u2019s environmental cleanup operations at $220 million, intended to assure there would be no delays in removing hexavalent chromium and RDX, resulting from weapons development, in nearby groundwater.Another $1 billion would go to LANL for ongoing plutonium operations and pit production, aiming to meet pit production requirements by 2026.More:U.S. Department of Energy to continue cleaning up New Mexico nuke sitesBill supports Sandia\u2019s National Laboratory\u2019s emergency operations centerThe NDAA would give $36 million for a new emergency operations center at Sandia, constructing a facility up to 31,000 square feet.The center would provide emergency assistance to improve Sandia\u2019s ability to respond to emergency situations, the release read, which are currently housed in the basement of a \u201csubstandard\u201d building built in 1949.The project was expected to take two years at a cost of about $40 million.More:Sandia National Laboratory hires thousands, spends million on contracts in New MexicoAdrian Hedden can be reached at 575-628-5516, achedden@currentargus.com or @AdrianHedden on Twitter."
