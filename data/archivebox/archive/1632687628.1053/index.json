What I don\u2019t get so far is the \u201cresidency period\u201d - what does that mean, and how is extending it good?\n\nThe act would also extend the residency period for foreign employees from three to five years and scrap a regulation requiring workers with permanent residency to stay in Taiwan for at least 183 days every year.\n\nMore here (I guess): https://join.gov.tw/attachments/e0812f68-9435-4cdc-a16e-cdd9aa053b68/download/%20Act%20for%20the%20Recruitment%20and%20Employment%20of%20Foreign%20Professional%20Talent%20(Draft).pdf\nedit, thanks to afterspivak: even more here http://focustaiwan.tw/news/aeco/201704200011.aspx\n        \n\n        \n          \n\n        3 Likes\n         \n\n         \n\n            \n      \n      \n        \n        \n          \nAs things stand, you can get up to three years of residence on an ARC, after which you have to renew it. Extending the period to five years means you have do deal with the red tape of renewing less often.\n        \n\n        \n\n        1 Like\n         \n\n         \n\n      \n      \n        \n        \n          There are some major advances in that bill.\nAllowing children of permanent ARC holders to work.\nFinally approving pension payments to permanent ARC holders. Long overdue but great to see.\nEven the tax reduction is an extremely progressive move.\nRemember those executives can go somewhere else and then Taiwan would get 0% income tax from them.\nI\u2019m impressed if it gets ratified.\n        \n\n        \n\n        2 Likes\n         \n\n         \n\n      \n      \n        \n          \n          \n            yyy\n            \n          \n\n          \n\n\n          \n              \n                April 21, 2017,  5:04am\n              \n              \n          #4\n          \n        \n        \n          Also, it doesn\u2019t seem to matter for most people, but the Labor Standards Act allows a contract to be for a fixed or indefinite (permanent) term, yet the Employment Service Act limits a (non-PR) foreigner\u2019s contract to a fixed term only, so an indefinite term is automatically shortened. With this change, indefinite contracts will still be automatically shortened, but to as long as five years.\n(The question of whether or not this violates the rights of foreigners, and specifically Americans because of an obscure pre-1949 treaty, is not completely settled.)\n\na work permit that allows foreign workers to transition between jobs without their employer\u2019s consent\n\nThis sounds interesting, but it\u2019s not clear what they mean. There\u2019s nothing on the MOL\u2019s website yet (nor about the new rules on work rights for spouses), as far as I can see.\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n\n         \n\n      \n      \n          Many positive proposals here.  The key word, though, is \u201cproposal.\u201d  Will this draft law make it through the legislature?  If it gets through, this would be huge.\nGuy\n        \n      \n          This is interesting. Unclear if this means a job with a different company or within the same company\n\nThat allows foreign workers to transition between jobs without their employer\u2019s consent\n\nThis is a nice welcome, but is there an age restriction?\n\nWhile children of holders of an alien permanent resident certificate would be allowed to work in Taiwan.  The spouse and children of foreign workers with an alien permanent resident certificate would also be able to apply for the certificate.\n\n        \n      \n        \n          \n          \n            astute\n            \n          \n\n          \n\n\n          \n              \n                April 21, 2017,  6:36am\n              \n              \n          #7\n          \n        \n        Any mention of allowing APRC holders to purchase real estate in their own name\u2026 would be a good enticement for \u201cForeign Experts\u201d to settle in Taiwan.\n\n        \n\n        \n\n         \n\n      \n      \n        \n        \n          Forward Taiwan has links to the draft documents in Chinese, it\u2019s 50 some pages long\n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        1 Like\n         \n\n         \n\n      \n      \n        \n        \n          \nForeigners are already able to purchase real estate in their own name, as long as their country allows Taiwanese the same right.

I\u2019m not nearly motivated enough to start a business, so my capital is secure. \n        \n      \n        \n        Good on you for doing that on a Taiwanese salary. My tactic is to milk my western salary for savings as long as I can. Hope I can get buy myself a decent box that won\u2019t suffocate me with mould.\n\n        \n\n        1 Like\n         \n\n         \n\n      \n      \n        \n          \n          \n            Icon\n            \n          \n\n          \n\n\n          \n              \n                April 21, 2017,  9:27am\n              \n              \n          #17\n          \n        \n        I got my money in retirement invetsments, health insurance payments and pet care. A house is totally out of the question.\n\n        \n\n        1 Like\n         \n\n         \n\n      \n      \n          \nConsidering Taiwan\u2019s astronomical real estate prices and relatively cheap rents, renting is probably cheaper in the long run anyway. Now if the Chicoms would just lob another missile in our general direction again, maybe prices would come down a little. \n        \n      \n          This piece from Focus Taiwan seems clearer than the Taipei Times piece linked by the OP:\n\n\nRemember folks: these are proposed amendments.  Still we can dare to dream they will be passed into law.\nGuy\n        \n      \n        \n        It was the SARS crisis wot done for the local property market way back in 2003. I\u2019d rather not go through that again though especially as some good people died in Taiwan.\n\n        \n\n        \n\n         \n\n      \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    "
