This data\nis refreshed automatically every Saturday at 01:09 UTC as well as on\nevery push to its GitHub\nrepository.\n\n\nDo not take the content size and content ratio columns too seriously.\nThe content size is calculated using refresh.js\nin the source code of the repository. It is not always accurate. For\nexample, it considers internal CSS to be content but external CSS to be\nnot content. Therefore, home pages that use CSS within an HTML page have\nan unfair advantage to get a higher content ratio than it should. 250 KB Club too suffers from the same\nissue.\n\n\nClub Rules\n\nEach website that is a member of the 10\u00a0KB Club is identified by a\nURL to its home page. The URL must satisfy the following rules:\n\n\n  \n    \n      If the URL is opened in a web browser with no ad blockers or\n      script blockers enabled, the compressed data that the web browser\n      has to fetch to load the complete web page must not exceed 10240\n      bytes. To check this on Firefox or Chrome, open a new\n      private/incognito window, then right click on the blank page and\n      select \"Inspect\", then go to the \"Network\" tab, and finally enter\n      the URL in the address bar and press enter. The transferred size\n      appears in the status bar at the bottom of the network tab.\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      The URL must point to a home page of the website. This is usually\n      the root directory of the domain, i.e., of the form https://www.example.com/ but\n      it need not always be so. An URL of the form https://www.example.com/alice/\n      is also okay as long as it is a home page of some website that\n      exists under that directory, i.e., a top-level user page within a\n      domain is considered as a website home page.\n    \n  \n    \n      The URL must point to a page that contains useful content (e.g.,\n      an article, a manifesto page, etc.) or a list of links to such\n      content (e.g., blog listing, catalog of websites, etc.) or a list\n      of links of which at least one points to a page with a list of\n      links to such content (e.g., a home page with navigation links to\n      blog listing, feed, etc.), or provides useful functionality (e.g.,\n      a web-based game, an online currency convertor, etc.).\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      The URL must not point merely to a page with metadata about a\n      person or an organization (e.g., welcome page, about page, contact\n      information page, etc. without any other content are not okay).\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      The website must be very noteworthy or some content from the\n      website must have received at least 100 points on\n      Reddit or\n      Hacker News on at\n      least one occasion. Use\n      this\n      Reddit link or\n      this\n      Hacker News link\n      to check submissions for a website in these\n      forums and the points the submissions have received. Replace\n      \"example.com\" with the domain of the website while visiting\n      these links above.\n    \n  \n\n\nNote that the manual steps provided for Firefox and Chrome in the 1st\npoint do not constitute a definitive decision criteria for membership.\nThe compressed transfer size computation for every website is automated\nin refresh.js.\nThe compressed transfer size observed by this script decides whether a\nwebsite satisfies the 1st rule. The compressed transfer size observed by\nthe script does not always exactly match what Firefox or Chrome shows.\nFor example, this script does not count the favicon transfer size,\nso the transfer size that this script determines is usually a little\nless than what Firefox or Chrome shows.\n\n\nIf a website's domain name or URL changed since one of its links\nreceived sufficient points on Reddit or Hacker News, as long as we can\nprove that the URL being submitted is indeed the same website from\nwhich some content received at least 100 points on Reddit or Hacker\nNews, it is eligible to be a member of this club. For example, if the\nold website URL redirects to the new website or if\nthe Wayback Machine shows that the\nold URL had the same content as the new one, or if it is obvious that\nthe content that was discussed on one of these forums now resides at a\nnew URL, then that would be sufficient proof of eligibility.\n\n\nNew Membership\n\nTo add a website as a member to this club, first ensure that it\nsatisfies the rules laid out in the Club Rules\nsection. If it satisfies the club rules, then create a new issue\non GitHub and provide the URL of the website.\n\n\n\n\n\n"
