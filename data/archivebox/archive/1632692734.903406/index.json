Perhaps in no case is the necessity of state\u2010\u200bsuperintendence so generally assumed; and in no case will the denial of that necessity cause so much surprise. Yet must the denial be made. 1\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n  So wrote Herbert Spencer, the Victorian polymath, in 1851, during a\u00a0period now seen as the apotheosis of laissez\u2010\u200bfaire economic thought. Yet even then, Spencer\u2019s thesis\u2014that legislative interference with money and currency \u201cis not only needless, but injurious\u201d\u2014was an extremely radical one. Spencer wasn\u2019t content to merely argue for open competition among rival private suppliers of paper currency, as he did by unfavorably comparing the results of the Bank of England\u2019s monopoly privileges with those of Scotland\u2019s less privileged (and less regulated) banks. He also dared to challenge the most ancient of all forms of government control of money by insisting that the minting of coins itself ought to be left to the private sector.\n\nSince Spencer wrote, studies of the Scottish \u201cfree\u201d banking system\u2014a remarkably unregulated and efficient yet famously stable commercial banking and currency system that flourished during the first half of the 19th century 2 \u2014and of several past competitive coinage systems, have shown that, for all its radicalism, Spencer\u2019s critique of state interference rested on solid empirical foundations. Just as importantly, it remains as true today as it was in Spencer\u2019s day that the only way to determine whether such interference is desirable is by asking what would happen without it.\n\n  \n\n\n  \n  \n\n  \n  Monetary Freedom, Then\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n  Answering that question is, however, never easy. Partly that\u2019s so because of \u201cstatus quo bias\u201d\u2014a natural tendency to assume that what\u2019s customary is necessarily best. The problem is one of which Spencer himself was well aware. \u201cSo much so does a\u00a0realized fact influence us than an imagined one,\u201d he wrote, \u201cthat had the baking and sale of bread been hitherto carried on by government\u2010\u200bagents, probably the supply of bread by private enterprise would scarcely be conceived possible, much less advantageous.\u201d 3\n\nYet it was far easier to envision a\u00a0monetary system independent of state interference in 1851 than it is now. Back then, the monetary systems of all advanced nations were based on units of gold or silver or (in so\u2010\u200bcalled bimetallic systems) both, and although state interference sometimes favored one metal over the other, one didn\u2019t have to suffer from status quo bias to take a\u00a0precious\u2010\u200bmetal standard of some sort for granted, as Spencer himself did.\n\nAnd although a\u00a0handful of nations, England among them, had rudimentary central banks that enjoyed special privileges, especially when it came to issuing circulating paper notes, others (like Scotland) allowed numerous commercial banks to issue notes and otherwise compete on roughly equal, if not liberal, terms. Although they were as yet few and far between, bank clearinghouses\u2014the agencies responsible for gathering notes and checks issued by or drawn on various banks, returning them to their sources, and arranging for the settlement of interbank dues\u2014were themselves still private institutions. Finally, although coining was a\u00a0state monopoly almost everywhere, an entirely private coinage system was thriving in California, whereas another had been snuffed out only a\u00a0few decades before by authorities in England. 4\n\nIn short, one did not have to look all that far, or to strain one\u2019s imagination, to realize how both coins and paper money might be manufactured and supplied entirely through private initiative, much as bank deposits are supplied today, except without the least hint of state interference.\n\n  \n\n\n  \n  \n\n  \n  Monetary Freedom, Now\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n  Today, governments are far more heavily involved in the business of supplying and regulating money than most were in Herbert Spencer\u2019s day. Here and there, to be sure, banks enjoy certain freedoms denied them in the past. In the United States, for instance, banks can now have branches across the nation, whereas before the 1990s, many were limited to a\u00a0single location only. But in many other respects, both here and elsewhere, banks are more heavily regulated than ever. Here in the United States, federally chartered (\u201cnational\u201d) banks are regulated by the Federal Reserve (the Fed), the Comptroller of the Currency, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), while most state\u2010\u200bchartered banks are regulated by the Fed and the FDIC as well as by state regulatory authorities. U.S. banks are also indirectly subject to international regulations, including those promulgated by the Basel Committee\u2014the global prudential regulatory authority housed within the Bank of International Settlements.\n\nWhile most forms of bank regulation limit what banks can do, ostensibly to prevent them from behaving imprudently, others actually tend to encourage imprudent behavior. Deposit insurance, which was relatively unknown before the 1930s, and which has since been adopted by most nations, falls into this category: by protecting depositors from losses, it encourages them to overlook the risks certain banks take, and even to patronize risky banks that pay higher rates on their deposits. 5\n\nAlthough the explicit coverage offered by government deposit insurance schemes is usually limited\u2014in the United States today, individual bank accounts are covered up to a (very generous) limit of $250,000\u2014creditors at very large or otherwise important financial institutions enjoy the equivalent of unlimited coverage, thanks to the now\u2010\u200bprevalent view among government officials that such institutions are \u201ctoo big to fail.\u201d Provided he or she keeps it at one of these institutions, a\u00a0creditor with a\u00a0balance well in excess of $250,000 has good reason to assume that, should the institution get into trouble, the government will rescue both it and its depositors.\n\nPerhaps most importantly, precious\u2010\u200bmetal monetary standards have given way to fiat\u2010\u200bmoney systems, in which the standard money unit is represented by nothing more substantial than an irredeemable slip of paper issued by some national central bank. Commercial banks have also stopped issuing paper money of any sort, except in three places: Scotland, Ireland, and Hong Kong. And even in those exceptional cases, note issue is very strictly regulated. All other commercial banks are limited to receiving and managing digital credit balances known, somewhat inaccurately, as \u201cdeposits,\u201d denominated and redeemable in official fiat money units.\n\nThe much\u2010\u200benlarged role of government in modern monetary systems makes it especially difficult to \u201cinquire what would result\u201d were the government to cease playing any role. Some might be tempted to suppose that ending the government\u2019s involvement now would necessarily lead to the spontaneous revival of market\u2010\u200bbased monetary arrangements of the past, including a\u00a0gold (or silver) standard. But the temptation ought to be resisted. To suppose that, were they given free rein today, market forces would restore the gold standard, or cause commercial banks to start issuing their own redeemable banknotes, just because these were features of less regulated monetary systems of the past, makes about as much sense as supposing that privatizing Amtrak would bring back steam locomotives. Instead, a\u00a0modern laissez\u2010\u200bfaire monetary system of the future might well have even less in common with a\u00a0circa 1851 laissez\u2010\u200bfaire system than with today\u2019s heavily regulated arrangements.\n\nBut just how great those differences will be, and what precise forms they take, will depend on precisely how we go about \u201cabolishing\u201d the \u201ccontrol exercised by lawgivers\u201d over today\u2019s system. It\u2019s easy enough to agree that doing so means doing away with both explicit and implicit deposit insurance so that all bank creditors have a\u00a0reason to consider the safety of the banks they do business with. Taking that step in turn paves the way for repealing all bank regulations designed to do something other than enforce voluntary contracts between commercial banks and the persons and institutions that deal with them, including usury laws and minimum reserve, capital, and \u201cliquidity\u201d requirements, among other regulations.\n\nIt\u2019s also easy enough to imagine a\u00a0reform that privatizes the present, Fed\u2010\u200boperated payments and settlement system by converting today\u2019s Federal Reserve banks into so many private clearinghouses, owned and governed by their member banks, by making commercial banks\u2019 participation in the newly privatized Fed system voluntary, and by allowing banks and other financial firms to either take part in that newly privatized system or to create or join alternative private arrangements.\n\nA privatized U.S. mint that\u2019s forced to compete with rivals in supplying banks with small change, consisting of \u201ctoken\u201d metallic coins as well as full\u2010\u200bbodied gold and silver \u201cbullion\u201d coins, for those who\u2019d rather deal in those metals, is also pretty easy to ponder, as are other private mints that compete directly with it. Finally, the advent of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies makes it easier than ever to imagine a\u00a0competitive market not just in bank\u2010\u200bsupplied digital dollars but in blockchain\u2010\u200bbased alternatives to dollar\u2010\u200bdenominated monies.\n\n  \n\n\n  \n  \n\n  \n  Plus \u00c7a Change \u2026\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n  What would such a\u00a0future, free\u2010\u200bmarket monetary system be like for the typical consumer? Would someone from the world today, time\u2010\u200btraveling to take part in it, find it utterly bizarre?\n\nAlthough there\u2019s no predicting the details of such a\u00a0system with any degree of accuracy, if past experience is any guide, it will have enough in common with today\u2019s arrangements to make it possible for our time traveler to quickly get the hang of it. Chances are that a\u00a0small number of general monetary standards, if not a\u00a0single standard, will prevail in most places. The prevailing standard monetary unit might still be the U.S. dollar (see the next section). Or it might be some cryptocurrency unit. Or it might be a\u00a0unit of gold, or of silver, or even of some foreign currency. Or we might see several (but probably not many) of these different standards operating in parallel, as happens already, though only to a\u00a0limited extent, in some parts of the world.\n\nIn the free system of the future, almost all transacting will be done digitally, and the vast majority of payments will be made using convertible substitutes, supplied by banks or other companies, for \u201cstandard\u201d money or monies\u2014the counterparts of today\u2019s transferable bank deposits. Those substitutes would include transferable deposits themselves\u2014where the transfers are mainly done using smartphone apps, debit cards having become old\u2010\u200bfashioned, much like checkbooks today. Smartphones could also carry digital \u201ccash\u201d balances\u2014the counterpart of old\u2010\u200bfashioned banknotes\u2014that could be transferred from one phone to another, with no need for recipients to have their own bank accounts. To enhance the acceptability of their digital cash, private issuers could establish and police cash\u2010\u200bprovider networks, not unlike the ATM networks in use today, so that consumers might confidently accept cash from any supplier belonging to a\u00a0trusted network. Although coins and paper money would largely be dispensed with, a\u00a0niche market for either might be supplied with private banknotes or privately manufactured token coins, rather than with the products of central banks or government mints.\n\nStanding behind these forms of private money itself would be an intricate clearing and settlement system, by which transfers of all sorts would be electronically executed, tracked, and reconciled or, when necessary, settled by firm\u2010\u200bto\u2010\u200bfirm transfers of designated standard monies. Those behind\u2010\u200bthe\u2010\u200bscenes private arrangements would function much like today\u2019s partly nationalized arrangements, though (thanks to private innovation) probably more economically and expeditiously.\n\n  \n\n\n  \n  \n\n  \n  A Free\u2010\u200bMarket Dollar?\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n  The hardest questions concern what to do with the U.S. dollar itself. Presently, as we\u2019ve seen, that dollar is a \u201cfiat\u201d unit, convertible into nothing else. The stock of \u201cbase\u201d dollars\u2014the modern counterpart of the stock of gold coins and bullion in the 19th century\u2014consists of the sum of Federal Reserve notes outstanding and banks\u2019 credit balances at their regional Federal Reserve banks and is regulated by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), a\u00a0semipublic central governing body. Will the dollar continue to serve as the nation\u2019s most basic monetary unit? If so, how will the supply of dollars be regulated, if not by a\u00a0bureaucratic committee? Must there still be an FOMC, or something like it? If not, is there an obvious free\u2010\u200bmarket alternative?\n\nConcerning the first question, although a\u00a0free\u2010\u200bmarket monetary system would exclude all barriers to the emergence of alternative monetary standards, it wouldn\u2019t necessarily result in the mass adoption of any of those alternatives. On the contrary, so long as the established dollar standard continued to command some confidence, powerful forces would incline people, both in and beyond the United States, to go on employing it. The choice of a\u00a0preferred monetary standard, like that of a\u00a0computer operating system, depends heavily on the size of its established network, making it relatively hard for new upstarts to gain a\u00a0foothold, let alone sweep the field.\n\nSo although alternative potential monetary standards, based on gold, one or more blockchain\u2010\u200bbased cryptocurrencies, or some foreign central bank unit, might gain adherents, the dollar would probably survive, at least for a\u00a0time. Nor would it be reasonable to look forward to, let alone take steps to achieve, its rapid overthrow: whatever long\u2010\u200brun gains such an overthrow might promise, the short\u2010\u200brun consequences could be dire. Innocent dollar holders both in the United States and abroad might suffer a\u00a0sudden decline in the value of their holdings. And even if they don\u2019t, the continued use of the dollar could mean both a\u00a0high level of uncertainty about the dollar\u2019s future value and a\u00a0substantial increase in the amplitude of the business cycle. Although it\u2019s true that Fed actions themselves have often contributed to booms, busts, and inflation, it hardly follows that simply doing away with the Fed will somehow make the dollar work better than ever!\n\nIf we aren\u2019t to simply abandon the dollar to some uncertain fate, how can we free it from government control? In one sense, we can\u2019t: unlike the gold dollars of yore, the paper dollar won\u2019t \u201cmanage itself.\u201d A\u00a0dollar bill today costs less than 6\u00a0cents to manufacture, while a $20 bill costs just under 11 cents. The Fed can also add dollars to commercial banks\u2019 balances at practically no cost at all. Consequently, allowing a\u00a0fully privatized and profit\u2010\u200bmaximizing set of Federal Reserve banks to create as many inconvertible dollars as they like would be asking for trouble.\n\nInstead, some alternative limit\u2014call it \u201cthe last monetary regulation\u201d\u2014must be placed on those banks\u2019 ability to issue dollars. Although that limit itself would have to be imposed and therefore wouldn\u2019t qualify as a \u201cmarket\u201d-based solution, when it comes to regulating the supply of dollars, it could at least serve to replace the \u201crule of men\u201d with the \u201crule of law.\u201d\n\n  \n\n\n  \n  \n\n  \n  Convertibility, or a\u00a0Quantity Rule?\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n  Broadly speaking, either of two rule\u2010\u200bbased means for regulating the quantity of dollars is possible. A \u201cconvertibility rule\u201d would make dollars once again convertible into some scarce commodity, like gold. A \u201cquantity rule\u201d would instead regulate their total quantity according to some definite formula. The convertibility rule owes its appeal to the fact that it has been successfully used in the past, particularly during the classical gold\u2010\u200bstandard era of 1871 to 1914.\n\nBut replicating that success won\u2019t be easy. For one thing, the classical gold standard\u2019s success rested on its having been not just a\u00a0U.S. standard but an international one. The classical gold standard\u2019s international status contributed to its appeal by guaranteeing stable exchange rates and also by limiting short\u2010\u200brun fluctuations in gold\u2019s purchasing power by reinforcing and stabilizing the world demand for that metal.\n\nMore important, the gold standard\u2019s success rested on people\u2019s confidence that banks\u2014including central banks\u2014would honor their convertibility commitments. That confidence, which remained more or less intact until the outbreak of World War I, was shattered afterward, especially during the 1930s, when nation after nation suspended convertibility. Subsequently, the United States alone offered to exchange dollars for gold, albeit at a\u00a0reduced rate and only for foreign central banks, until the late 1960s, when it also abandoned the gold standard.\n\nToday, thanks to that experience, people are naturally wary of central banks\u2019 convertibility pledges. Consequently, such pledges\u2014which in recent decades have taken the form of commitments to maintain a\u00a0fixed rate of exchange between one central bank currency and another\u2014have become vulnerable to \u201cspeculative attacks.\u201d In such attacks, currency speculators, betting that the commitment will be dishonored, seek to convert as much of the central bank\u2019s currency as possible at the promised exchange rate. Because such attacks tend to exhaust a\u00a0central bank\u2019s foreign exchange reserves, the prophecy that gives rise to them is often self\u2010\u200bfulfilling.\n\nThe public\u2019s newfound tendency to distrust central banks\u2019 convertibility commitments poses an obvious problem for any modern attempt to reestablish an official gold standard. Speculators will be tempted to \u201ctest\u201d any renewed offer by the Fed or any other central bank to convert its currency into gold at a\u00a0fixed rate. And such testing could cause even a\u00a0central bank with the best of intentions to renege on its offer, causing the new regime to collapse.\n\nThe risk of a\u00a0successful speculative attack would of course be mitigated by equipping the central bank with gold reserves fully equal to its outstanding (currency and bank reserve balance) liabilities. In that case, the central bank would never be compelled to suspend or devalue by the prospect of running out of gold. But doing that wouldn\u2019t be as simple as it sounds.\n\nToday, the Fed\u2019s liabilities amount to about $4.4 trillion. Even assuming a\u00a0reduction to just $2 trillion\u2014a far more aggressive \u201cunwind\u201d of the Fed\u2019s crisis\u2010\u200bera asset purchases than presently appears likely\u2014the government\u2019s gold stock, valued at gold\u2019s mid\u2010\u200b2018 price of about $1,200 an ounce, would be worth about $314 billion, or less than one\u2010\u200bsixth the value of the Fed\u2019s liabilities. To allow for 100 percent cover, gold\u2019s official price would have to be set at over $7,600 an ounce, which high gold parity, as Lawrence White has explained (in a\u00a0somewhat different context), would imply \u201ca large influx of gold from the rest of the world, a\u00a0large loss of other U.S. wealth in exchange, and a\u00a0sharp transitional U.S. inflation.\u201d 6\n\nBecause it doesn\u2019t invite speculative attacks, a\u00a0quantity rule offers a\u00a0more reliable (or far less expensive) alternative for nonbureaucratic control of the dollar supply. Many alternative quantity rules are possible, but this isn\u2019t the place to argue the virtues and drawbacks of various alternatives. However, any desirable rule should satisfy at least two requirements. First, if consistently abided by, it should guarantee a\u00a0reasonably stable and predictable value for the dollar, especially in the long run. 7 Second, the rule should be \u201chardwired\u201d into the monetary system, as it might be by enshrining it in a\u00a0constitutional amendment, or by allowing the public to trade in existing Federal Reserve dollars for new \u201ccryptodollars\u201d whose supply, like Bitcoin\u2019s, is regulated by a\u00a0tamperproof computer algorithm.\n\n  \n\n\n  \n  \n\n  \n  A Level Monetary Playing Field\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n  To argue for rules that would allow the dollar to survive in a\u00a0future state of monetary freedom isn\u2019t to say that it must survive, much less that it should not have to compete with rival currencies. On the contrary: if monetary freedom means anything, it means that people are free to choose what sort or sorts of money they will keep on hand, or accept from others, in exchange for their labor, goods, or services. And enjoying such freedom in turn means that government regulations neither compel people to use any particular sort of currency nor prevent entrepreneurs from marketing alternatives to the dollar, whether those alternatives consist of foreign currencies, precious metals, or digital code.\n\nTo offer some specifics: there would be no such thing as \u201clegal tender\u201d in a\u00a0free monetary system. The government and its agencies might, for the sake of convenience, specify the currency standard in which they prefer to receive tax payments and fees. But they would be expected to accept any private currency denominated in that unit and supplied by a\u00a0firm that is in good standing (e.g., a\u00a0bank that is a\u00a0member of the local clearinghouse). To allow that option is merely to place the government on a\u00a0footing similar to that of private merchants, who would likewise be allowed to choose which currencies to accept, and who would furthermore be allowed to refuse the currency of any specific issuer or issuers.\n\nEntry into the business of supplying alternative \u201cstandard\u201d monies (meaning monies that are not themselves claims to other monies) would be free, with legal requirements applicable to any ordinary business. Requirements would include sanctions imposed on suppliers that dishonor their contractual obligations or are found guilty of fraud, including the counterfeiting of any rival producers\u2019 goods, when that\u2019s possible. Because the principle of \u201ccaveat emptor\u201d would apply, those contemplating using unfamiliar alternative currencies would have every reason to inform themselves about the issuers of those currencies and to read the fine print accompanying their contracts.\n\nNor should that circumstance change once one or more of these alternatives achieve widespread use. So long as consumers retain an incentive to shop for quality, they are likely to be well served by various product\u2010\u200brating services, which are no less capable of reporting on the quality and performance record of various alternative monies than they are today of reporting on the quality and performance of cellphones, automobiles, and mutual funds. Firms may also have strong incentives to investigate products issued by their rivals, and to expose their flaws, much as California\u2019s rival mints did during the 1850s.\n\nFinally, banks and other private financial institutions should be free to manage deposits and make loans in any currency unit their customers prefer. In doing so, they will almost certainly stick to the traditional practice of matching liabilities in any one currency with loans made in the same currency so as to avoid exposing themselves to unnecessary exchange rate risk. But here again, the best guarantee that such prudent procedures will be followed consists, as usual, of the expectation that imprudently managed banks will be allowed to fail, that their shareholders will be wiped out before their creditors bear any losses, and, finally, that creditors may themselves suffer if they do business with a\u00a0poorly run bank.\n\n  \n\n\n  \n  \n\n  \n  Freedom and Failure\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n  Indeed, of all the forms of government interference in modern banking systems, none poses a\u00a0greater barrier to the achievement of genuine freedom in banking than the various guarantees, whether explicit or implicit, aimed at protecting bank depositors from losses if their banks fail. By removing natural incentives for depositors to avoid excessively risky banks, or to seek correspondingly high interest rates from banks that make risky investments, such guarantees remove market discipline from the banking system, encouraging banks to engage in risky lending for the sake of attracting depositors who don\u2019t bear any of the risk themselves. Then, to compensate for the lack of market discipline, regulators are compelled to impose all sorts of other \u201cprudential\u201d regulations on banks, including minimum reserve requirements, liquidity coverage ratios, minimum capital requirements, and limitations on the sorts of loans they can make, in the hope that doing so will make up for the fact that bank depositors couldn\u2019t care less about how safe their banks are.\n\nIt follows then that if we are ever to have a\u00a0less regulated banking system, we must start by doing away with those government guarantees. Reducing the power and privileges of the central bank, so that it can\u2019t simply bail out any bank it deems \u201ctoo big to fail,\u201d is an obviously important step, and one that is a\u00a0natural component of any plan to put central bank money creation on automatic pilot. But explicit deposit insurance, such as that provided in the United States by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, must be rolled back as well. That\u2019s because such insurance now protects individual deposit balances up to $250,000, a\u00a0sum equal to about half of all bank deposits (the rest of which are mainly held by \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d banks). In other words, the vast majority of bank depositors have no reason to worry that their banks may be unsafe.\n\nTo many, it seems unreasonable to place any part of the burden of bank failures on banks\u2019 creditors, and on ordinary depositors especially. Such depositors, the popular view has it, are often too unsophisticated to tell the difference between a\u00a0safe bank and a\u00a0dangerous one. They therefore require extra protection, in the shape of deposit insurance or, alternatively, a\u00a0postal saving system or other \u201cnarrow\u201d banking arrangement, in which their deposits are fully backed by cash or other safe assets.\n\nBut so long as depositors, or many of them, value bank safety, a\u00a0free market in money will include a\u00a0market for safe money, including deposits that are well secured by some combination of bank capital and safe bank assets. And it isn\u2019t difficult, after all, for bank customers to inform themselves of the relative safety of different banks, so long as they have any incentive to do so. Although it\u2019s true that an ordinary bank customer is unlikely to be informed of the quality of a\u00a0bank\u2019s loans, a\u00a0customer prizing safety above other advantages can look for a\u00a0bank with a\u00a0large capital cushion or a\u00a0portfolio heavy on cash and government securities. Provided enough such customers exist, banks wishing to attract them will flaunt these features of their balance sheets, as U.S. banks often did before the days of federal deposit insurance. And here also, various consumer rating services and watchdog publications might be expected to come to the public\u2019s aid.\n\nThat safe banks will exist for those who put safety first doesn\u2019t mean, of course, that banks catering to \u201chigh rollers\u201d won\u2019t also exist. In a\u00a0free and competitive economy, different firms may cater to different sorts of consumers; banks are no exception. Some will display their high (non\u2010\u200brisk\u2010\u200badjusted) deposit rates for the sake of attracting deposits from more risk\u2010\u200bloving clients, whereas others will advertise their high ratios of capital government securities and cash to a\u00a0risk\u2010\u200baverse clientele. Will some who can\u2019t afford to be tempted nonetheless place their life savings in the least safe banks? The answer, alas, is almost certainly yes, just as some will patronize casinos and horse races. In Hong Kong, where I\u00a0lived during the mid\u2010\u200b1980s, and where there was as yet no deposit insurance, everyone knew that the major \u201cEuropean\u2010\u200bstyle\u201d banks were much safer than most of the local banks, while the local banks often paid higher deposit rates. Yet many poorer people preferred the local banks, presumably for the same reason that many enjoyed patronizing mahjong parlors.\n\nIt would be foolish, therefore, to suppose that a\u00a0truly free banking system of the future would be one in which banks never failed. But it doesn\u2019t follow that free banking would itself be undesirable. As the late Allan Meltzer famously observed: \u201cCapitalism without failure is like religion without sin. It doesn\u2019t work.\u201d 8 One wants to allow for variety and innovation, to cater to the needs of different consumers and also to allow for the discovery of new and better ways of banking. But doing that means having banks fail occasionally.\n\nIf the experience of free banking systems is any guide, those failures needn\u2019t involve major losses to bank creditors\u2014most would avoid such losses altogether. Nor would they give way to full\u2010\u200bfledged banking crises. Instead, failures would be limited to particular banks. The reason for this is that troubled banks in a\u00a0truly free\u2010\u200bmarket banking system tend to close down rapidly, as private creditors abandon them, before their losses can accumulate to the point of wiping out their capital. That happens mainly because such a\u00a0system has no \u201clast resort\u201d lenders that can keep such banks on artificial life support. Unlike many central banks, including the Fed, that have dismal records when it comes to shoring up or bailing out reckless banks that deserve to fail, private banks tend to be very good at telling unsound banks from sound banks and offering last\u2010\u200bminute aid to the sound ones only. For that reason, a\u00a0free banking system tends to quickly weed out unsound banks before they suffer losses big enough to exhaust their capital.\n\n  \n\n\n  \n  \n\n  \n  A Future without Fractional Reserves?\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n  Although deregulated banks catering to risk\u2010\u200baverse customers might do so in part by keeping larger\u2010\u200bthan\u2010\u200busual cash cushions, they would more likely do so by holding government securities and other assets that, although still relatively safe, would at least earn some interest.\n\nBut even if some free banks succeeded in marketing 100\u2010\u200bpercent\u2010\u200breserve accounts, such accounts would be exceedingly unlikely to sweep the board. On the one hand, there would be no rules to prohibit voluntary acts of fractional\u2010\u200breserve banking among consenting adults in a\u00a0free society. Despite what Austrian economist Murray Rothbard and some of his followers claim, there\u2019s nothing inherently fraudulent about fractional\u2010\u200breserve banking, the legal basis for which derives from ancient law. 9 Experience suggests, moreover, that whenever banks have been relatively unhindered by regulations and bank depositors have been unprotected by guarantees, fractional\u2010\u200breserve banking has thrived.\n\nOn the other hand, 100\u2010\u200bpercent\u2010\u200breserve banks have been rare historically and have tended to thrive only where regulations artificially favored them, either by granting them subsidies or by outlawing fractional\u2010\u200breserve rivals. Indeed, until the advent of government deposit insurance, regulations tended to hamper rather than encourage fractional\u2010\u200breserve banking. Thus, although many governments imposed minimum reserve requirements on banks, so far as the record indicates, none have ever insisted on a\u00a0maximum reserve requirement.\n\nNor, finally, would the survival of fractional\u2010\u200breserve banking depend in any way on that of the dollar. Just as fractional\u2010\u200breserve banking systems have grown on the foundation of all sorts of past monetary standards, whether fiat or metallic, so too might one flourish on the basis of any future standard. Although some fans of Bitcoin seem to think otherwise, there is also no reason to suppose that the spread of crypocurrencies would prove fatal to fractional\u2010\u200breserve banking, as banks might play the same role in lending and borrowing cryptocurrency\u2010\u200bdenominated funds, and in creating close cryptocurrency substitutes, as they played in specie\u2010\u200bbased monetary systems of the past and as they play in today\u2019s world of fiat monies.\n\nWere the Bitcoin unit to become widely adopted as a\u00a0unit of account, prices would be expressed in it and contracts written in it. Those contracts would include debt contracts, specifying that a\u00a0loan of X\u00a0units of Bitcoin today is to be repaid in X\u00a01 Y\u00a0units at some future date. Such debt contracts could take many forms, including bank deposit contracts that allow deposit holders to redeem any part of their Bitcoin credit balances on demand while allowing them to earn interest (again, in Bitcoin) on those balances so long as they retain them.\n\nIn short, in a\u00a0free economy, so long as opportunities exist for profitable lending and borrowing, there will be banks and fractionally backed bank money, and that will be so regardless of the basic form of money people employ.\n\n  \n\n\n  \n  \n\n  \n  Other Aspects of Future Monetary Freedom\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n  But perhaps I\u2019m dwelling too much on old\u2010\u200bfashioned banking. The truth is that a\u00a0truly free monetary system of the future might be one in which the banks and means of payments we\u2019re familiar with today no longer play such an important role. It\u2019s quite possible, for example, that not long from now, if regulators allow it, most of us will pay for things using our cellphones, rather than debit cards (let alone cash or checks), and that wallets (I mean, the nonelectronic kind) will become curiosities and eventually collector\u2019s items, like so many slide rules. And in a\u00a0truly free monetary system, firms like Walmart and Amazon, to name just two, that presently play only a\u00a0small part in the payments business would take on a\u00a0much larger one. Who knows?\n\nOnly one thing can be said with confidence regarding future monetary innovations: there will be more of them, and better ones, in an open and competitive monetary and banking system than there ever could be in the heavily centralized and regulated system of today. We know that not just because common sense leads us to think so, but because the freest money and banking systems of the past, like the Scottish system, were also the most innovative. As banking consultant Eric Grover observed a\u00a0while back, those crafty Scottish bankers of long ago \u201cinvented branch banking, interest\u2010\u200bbearing savings accounts, overdrafts, lines of credit, and two\u2010\u200bsided and multicolor banknotes,\u201d 10 among other things\u2014all while achieving a\u00a0record for safety that any bank regulator today might envy. If Scottish bankers could do all those things centuries ago, who can say what novel improvements today\u2019s financial market entrepreneurs might come up with, if only we let them?\n\nBut as impossible as it is to foresee the technical innovations that a\u00a0future free monetary regime would bring forth, it\u2019s also important to recognize that such innovations will take hold only to the extent that people voluntarily embrace them: unlike government regulatory agencies, private financial firms cannot force new arrangements on an unwilling public. For that reason, it\u2019s also likely that a\u00a0free monetary system of the not\u2010\u200btoo\u2010\u200bdistant future would continue to retain many of the features of today\u2019s arrangements. That system would, in all likelihood, comprise one or at most a\u00a0small number of prevailing \u201cstandard\u201d monies; it would also have numerous competing issuers of convenient substitutes for those standard monies, where the substitutes consist of instantly redeemable and readily transferable IOUs denominated in the basic money units.\n\nOf course, the specifics would differ. Digital or commodity standard monies might circulate alongside, or replace, \u201cfiat\u201d standard money; \u201cbanks\u201d (using that term broadly to refer to firms supplying convenient substitutes for standard money), instead of operating brick\u2010\u200band\u2010\u200bmortar facilities, might offer online services only; and transfers in bank\u2010\u200bsupplied money might be affected using cellphones instead of debit cards or checks.\n\nBut apart from such superficial differences, the everyday experience of making payments would not be fundamentally different from what it is now. The real differences would consist not so much in how money would work, but in its overall convenience and dependability. And in those respects, as Herbert Spencer long ago insisted, the change would almost certainly be for the good.\n\n  \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n  \n      1.
