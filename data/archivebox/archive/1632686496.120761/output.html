      <p>Fall 2018. This is a failed attempt at building a mouse that would do the following: violently shake when moving past an advertisement, disable clicking on "buy now" buttons, cause cursor to move extremely slow. In retrospect this mouse lived up to its own name because it never actually worked.</p>
