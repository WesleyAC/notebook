</p><h1>Pi and the Mandelbrot set</h1>
<p>Around 1991, Dave Boll found experimentally a strange connection between
pi and the Mandelbrot set.
<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/sci.math/browse_frm/thread/8c76037fe4e6d3ef/ec6bfa104102377d?lnk=st&amp;q=group:sci.math+insubject:Pi+insubject:Mandelbrot&amp;rnum=5&amp;hl=en#ec6bfa104102377d">HERE</a> is that post.

In 1992 some discussion on his questions was posted in a newsgroup.  The material
was then included in two books by Peitgen, Jürgens and Saupe:
<i>Chaos and Fractals</i> (Springer-Verlag 1992) pages 859-862; and 
<i>Fractals for the Classroom</i> (Springer-Verlag 1992) Part two,
pages 431-434.

A reference for this approach is the Guckenheimer &amp; Holmes book,
"Nonlinear Oscillations ...", section 6.8.  I agree, it is "heuristic".

The point -3/4 can he dealt with similarly.  The function f(z) = z^2-3/4
has fixed point -1/2 with eigenvalue -1.  So we use f(f(z)) to get
eigenvalue +1.  Transform coordinates z = -1/2 + y so that we are
interested in what happens for y near 0.  Consider the
transformations z^2 - 3/4 + i*r, for small, positive, r.  After some
algebra, we get the differential equation:

     dy         4      3          2              2
    ----   =   y  - 2 y  + 2 I r y  - 2 I r y - r
     dt

(Here I = sqrt(-l).)  The time the trajectory spends near 0 (say between
-1 and 1) is the integral

       1
       /
       |                 1
       | ---------------------------------- dy
       |  4      3         2              2
      /  y  - 2 y  +2 I r y  - 2 I r y - r
     -l

Its asymptotics are now shown in the articles called
"Asymptotics of an integral" in sci.math.symbolic.  We conclude that
if n is the number of steps required for divergence, then
n is asymptotic to  Pi/(2*r).  Actually, this is the number of steps
for the composition f(f(z)), so the number of steps for f(z) itself
is double this, Pi/r.  So: Mr. Boll's asymptotic behavior is vindicated.

This is a heuristic argument, so there could be some work done to make it
rigorous . . .

Now, is -5/4 the next spot to study?  Or how about -2 ?

 I took a look at several other points including -1.75. I found that 
 there are similar relationships with different exponents on n. The 
 trick is finding a reasonable path to follow.  At -0.75 the i direction
 is apparent.  At -1.75 a parabolic path worked, as I recall.  The path 
 has to follow nicely out through the filaments with out crossing them.
 The exponent depends on your parameterization of the path.

The thing that really blows my mind is that this phenomenon, namely that for parabolic Julia sets, the escape rate in a neighbourhood of the landing point of a ray that goes to the Julia set at the (forward orbit of) the critical value shows up in my PhD thesis!  Basically, what I show there is that there is a relation between the speed of escape of such points (in this case, polynomial in the number of iterations) and the "geometry" of the Julia set (basically what kind of 'wedges' one can stick in along landing rays).  Linear wedges (in the natural coordinates) correspond to any case where there is a hyperbolic metric, corresponding to exponential escapes.  When one gets to polynomial escapes, the wedges are asymptotically narrower (think x^2 around 0), which is what one observes in the parabolic and (conjecturally) in some of the Siegel cases too [ie in the exterior of the Siegel domains, the interior parts in those cases are simple].  These Julia sets (conjecturally in my thesis, but I believe that has been proven since) correspond exactly to those where the exterior conformal map extends to a Hölder continuous map on the circle
