                    "\nThe Library Genesis ProjectThe project's homepage with the English interfaceAvailable\u00a0inEnglishURLlibgen.funlibgen.rs (unofficial)[1]CommercialNoRegistrationNoCurrent\u00a0statusActive\n\nLibrary Genesis (Libgen) is a file-sharing based shadow library website for scholarly journal articles, academic and general-interest books, images, comics, audiobooks, and magazines. The site enables free access to content that is otherwise paywalled or not digitized elsewhere.[2] Libgen describes itself as a \"links aggregator\" providing a searchable database of items \"collected from publicly available public Internet resources\" as well as uploaded \"from users\".[3]\nControversy surrounds the copyright status of many works accessible through this website. For example, Libgen provides access to PDFs of content from Elsevier's ScienceDirect web-portal. Some publishers like Elsevier have accused Library Genesis of providing pirate access to articles and books. In turn, others assert that academic publishers benefit from government-funded research, written by professors\u2014many of whom are employed by public universities.[4]\n\n\n\nHistory[edit]\nLibrary Genesis has roots in the illegal underground samizdat culture in the Soviet Union. In a society where access to printing was strictly controlled by heavy-handed censorship, dissident intellectuals hand copied and retyped manuscripts for secret circulation. This was legalized under President Mikhail Gorbachev in the 1980s, and expanded very rapidly at a time of affordable desktop computers and scanners, and very small research budgets. The volunteers moved into the Russian computer network (\"RuNet\") in the 1990s, which became awash with hundreds of thousands of uncoordinated contributions. Librarians became especially active, using borrowed access passwords to download copies of scientific and scholarly articles from Western Internet sources, then uploading them to RuNet. In the early 21st century, the efforts became coordinated, and integrated into one massive system known as Library Genesis, or LibGen, around 2008.[5][6][7] It subsequently absorbed the contents of, and became the functional successor to, library.nu, which was shut down by legal action in 2012.[8] By 2014, its catalog was more than twice the size of library.nu with 1.2 million records.[6] As of 28\u00a0July\u00a02019, Library Genesis claims to have more than 2.4\u00a0million non-fiction books, 80\u00a0million science magazine articles, 2\u00a0million comics files, 2.2\u00a0million fiction books, and 0.4 million magazine issues.[9]\nIn 2020, the founder of the project created a new website under an alternate domain, \"libgen.fun\", due to internal conflict within the project.[10] As a result, databases are being maintained independently and content differs between libgen.fun and other Libgen domains.\n\nLegal issues[edit]\nIn 2015, Library Genesis became involved in a legal case with Elsevier, which accused it of copyright infringement and granting free access to articles and books. In response, the admins accused Elsevier of gaining most of its profits from publicly funded research which should be freely available to all as they are paid for by taxpayers.[4] Libgen is reported to be registered in both Russia and Amsterdam, making the appropriate jurisdiction for legal action unclear.[4][11] Libgen is blocked by a number of ISPs in the United Kingdom,[12] but such DNS-based blocks are claimed to do little to deter access.[4] It is also blocked by ISPs in France,[13] Germany,[14] Greece,[15] Belgium (which redirects to the Belgian Federal Police blockpage),[16] and Russia.[17] In late October 2015, the District Court for the Southern District of New York ordered Libgen to shut down and to suspend use of the domain name (libgen.org),[18] but the site is accessible through alternate domains.[19][20]\n\nUsage[edit]\nUntil the end of 2014, Sci-Hub, which provides free access to millions of research papers and books, relied on LibGen as storage. Papers requested by users were requested from LibGen and served from there if available, otherwise they were fetched by other means and then stored on LibGen.[21]\nIn 2019 archivists and freedom of information activists launched a project to better seed and host LibGen's data dumps.[22] The project's spokesperson and coordinator 'shrine' described the effort as a way for a \"permanent library card for the world\" and reported that the response has been \"overwhelmingly positive from everyone\".[23] In 2020, the project launched a peer-to-peer digital library of content on Sci-Hub and Library Genesis using IPFS.[24][25]\n\nSee also[edit]\nICanHazPDF\nSci-Hub\nGuerilla Open Access Manifesto\nSamizdat\nReferences[edit]\n\n^ \"Outcome of Libgen fork\". libgen.life. 2021-01-12.
