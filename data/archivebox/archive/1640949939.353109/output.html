After 22 months of anyone who breathed a word of criticism of the CDC on any mainstream part of Reddit being attacked as an antivaxxer or accused of giving them aid and comfort, Reddit is awash in memes openly mocking the CDC, e.g.:<br><br><p align="center"><a href="https://siderea.dreamwidth.org/file/314589.png"><img src="https://siderea.dreamwidth.org/file/480x480/314589.png" alt="Screenshot on r/antiwork: Tweet @roxiqt: &quot;SCIENTISTS: People are contagious for 10 days  CORPORATIONS: [sliding the CDC a $20]  THE CDC: So people can stop isolating after 5 days  SCIENTISTS: what  THE CDC: Remember, we're all -working together-  to end the pandemic.&quot;" title="Screenshot on r/antiwork 2021 Dec 28: Tweet @roxiqt &quot;SCIENTISTS: People are contagious for 10 days  CORPORATIONS: [sliding the CDC a $20]  THE CDC: So people can stop isolating after 5 days  SCIENTISTS: what  THE CDC: Remember, we're all -working together-  to end the pandemic.&quot;" class="imageshrink-actualsize"></a><br>(<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/rqgrop/again_the_result_of_living_under_a_capitalist/">Source</a>)</p><a name="cutid1"></a><br><p align="center"><a href="https://siderea.dreamwidth.org/file/314628.png"><img src="https://siderea.dreamwidth.org/file/480x480/314628.png" alt="Screenshot on r/antiwork 2021 Dec 28: Tweet @movingsidewarys &quot;CDC shortens isolation requirement to: 'Whatever your boss needs.'&quot;" title="Screenshot on r/antiwork 2021 Dec 28: Tweet @movingsidewarys &quot;CDC shortens isolation requirement to: 'Whatever your boss needs.'&quot;" class="imageshrink-actualsize"></a><br>(<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/rqx43r/weve_reached_the_meh_phase_of_the_pandemic/">Source</a>)</p><br><br>That's merely on the leftist r/antiwork – that's perhaps more interesting than it seems, because leftish circles have generally be pretty pro-CDC, taking the position that clearly the good scientists of the CDC were being suppressed by the Trump administration and were clearly on the side of the little people.<br><br>But as remarkable a change in public sentiment that was, that the following were posted to <strong>r/nursing</strong> was even more so:<br><br><p align="center"><a href="https://siderea.dreamwidth.org/file/313880.png"><img src="https://siderea.dreamwidth.org/file/480x480/313880.png" alt="Screenshot on r/nursing 2021 Dec 28: Tweet @Abbas_Muntaqim &quot;The CDC stands for Can't Disrupt Capitalism&quot;" title="Screenshot on r/nursing 2021 Dec 28: Tweet @Abbas_Muntaqim &quot;The CDC stands for Can't Disrupt Capitalism&quot;" class="imageshrink-actualsize"></a><br>(<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nursing/comments/rqi2it/this_one_got_me/">Source</a>)</p><br><br>That, btw, was tagged NSFW.

It is part of what is informally called "Meddit": medical Reddit, the constellation of very large (very populous) Reddit forums for healthcare providers.  As such, it generally is pretty... <em>establishment</em>.  And as such, it most definitely has not been anti-CDC, or even tolerated criticism of the CDC.<br><br>Until this week.<br><br>The proximate cause was two things in rapid succession, only one of which is actually the CDC's fault.<br><br>First the CDC issued "guidance" on Thursday 2021 Dec 23 – <em>right</em> before the holiday weekend, so it didn't come to most people's attention until <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2021/s1227-isolation-quarantine-guidance.html">the CDC issued a press release about it on Monday 2021 Dec 27</a> – that (per the press release) said: <blockquote>Given what we currently know about COVID-19 and the Omicron variant, CDC is shortening the recommended time for isolation from 10 days for people with COVID-19 to 5 days, if asymptomatic, followed by 5 days of wearing a mask when around others. The change is motivated by science demonstrating that the majority of SARS-CoV-2 transmission occurs early in the course of illness, generally in the 1-2 days prior to onset of symptoms and the 2-3 days after. Therefore, people who test positive should isolate for 5 days and, if asymptomatic at that time, they may leave isolation if they can continue to mask for 5 days to minimize the risk of infecting others.</blockquote> Even more alarming to healthcare providers was what was in the actual "guidance" document, titled <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2021/s1223-emergency-guidance-prepare-for-omicron.html">Emergency Guidance for Healthcare Facilities to Prepare for Potential Omicron Surge</a> , emphasis mine: <blockquote>Healthcare workers with COVID-19 who are asymptomatic can return to work after 7 days with a negative test, and <b>that isolation time can be cut further if there are staffing shortages.</b></blockquote>    That was one thing. The other was that it, apparently, only <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/rpv64a/aha_says_not_to_delay_cpr_on_covid_patients_just/">on this Monday (2021 Dec 27) came to the attention of Meddit</a> that the American Heart Association (AHA) had, back in October 2021, <a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/CIRCOUTCOMES.121.008396">issued "guidance"</a> saying: <blockquote>Do not delay chest compressions for provider PPE or to place a face covering on the patient</blockquote> and <blockquote>Defibrillate as soon as possible when indicated; do not delay defibrillation for application of masks or other PPE.</blockquote>  Meddit melted down.  As one physician put it on r/medicine: <blockquote>u/FaFaRog [MD]<br><br>Holy shit just when we thought we couldn't be treated as any more expendable. It's almost like they're asking for a mass walkout.</blockquote>  The significance of these may not be readily apparent to people outside of medicine.  <br><br>The first thing you need to understand is that  the "guidance" of the CDC and AHA isn't just a nice suggestion, any more than Henry II's "Will no one rid me of this turbulent priest?" was just an idle musing about the future.  This sort of "guidance", one from a government agency, the other from a professional medical org, might as well have the force of law.  Because they establish the "standard of care", medical <em>employers</em> such as hospital, clinic, and ambulance company administrators, treat it as gospel and enforce it upon their staffs, because if you follow the standard of care, that's a get-out-of-malpractice-free, make-the-insurance-pay-for-it card.<br><br>The second thing you need to understand is what both the CDC and AHA guidance under discussion have done – or at least this is how Meddit is resoundingly taking it –  is give hospitals and other medical employers legal permission to jeopardize the lives of their medical staff and patients.<br><br>I mean, jeopardize them <em>even further</em> than they'd already been doing.<br><br>Meddit's taking it personally.<br><br>It's funny:  I think if the CDC guidance had come out by itself, it wouldn't have gotten quite the reaction it has.  It isn't actually <em>as</em> out of line with the science as one might think from the reactions, though the "or less if there's a staffing shortage" has really confronted everyone in medicine with the fact, which many have been long in denial about, that the CDC is issuing guidance that is subordinating the safety of individuals – of the providers on the front lines – to the functioning of the institutions they work for.<br><br>(As if those were separable.  As if those workers weren't already feeling exploited and abused by those institutions.)<br><br>But by a quirk of fate, the CDC's "guidance" didn't hit Meddit by itself: the news about the AHA guidance showed up right on its heels, and <em>that</em> "guidance" is <em>completely insane</em>. Their instruction to healthcare professionals <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/rpv64a/comment/hq6s7dd/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">not to don PPE before commencing CPR is–</a> <blockquote>u/seamslegit [Critical Care]:<br><br>So offensive and completely without any science to back it up. Telling healthcare workers to place themselves at risk to gain a few seconds of resuscitation that will likely have the same outcome is like telling firefighters they should run into a burning building without PPE. First the CDC and now the AHA pisses away their credibility.<br><br>u/cats822:<br><br>Right how many of these codes are successful?! We almost need to go the opposite and say no CPR<br><br>u/Dktathunda [USA ICU MD]:<br><br>This. CPR in COVID patients w hypoxemia is almost always futile.<br><br>u/NYCEmImCCm<br><br>If you code from hypoxia while on 100%FiO2 and 20 of peep, you have a 0% chance of survival.</blockquote> And in case it weren't clear what is being asked of providers by that AHA "guidance": <blockquote>u/Renovatio_ [Paramedic]<br><br>Fun story.<br><br>Was running a code on a covid patient. At the head prepping for an airway. Mac in. Cords visualized. And then the n95 breaks and the masks falls off my face... All while I was about 6 inches from their mouth with compressions puffing direct covid air into my face a hundred times a minute<br><br>I tested covid positive 5 days later.</blockquote>  And that is why Meddit is <em>really</em> unhappy right now.<br><br>But what's most fascinating to me about that discussion on r/medicine is that it's about something the <em>AHA</em> did, but it's relentlessly "and the CDC".  Commenters keep bringing the CDC into it, as in the comment above from u/seamslegit, "First the CDC and now the AHA pisses away their credibility." For example: <blockquote>u/Manleather [MLS]<br><br>The explosion of travel gigs has always seemed to me like a slow motion walkout. Between this and CDC's wargarble earlier, I don't think that's going to be slowing down.<br><br>u/Comfortable-Class479 [Nurse]<br><br>Best response<br><br>1st the CDC and this<br><br>u/DeleteBowserHistory<br><br>Wait, the CDC also says to do this?<br><br>u/Comfortable-Class479 [Nurse]<br><br>They changed the timeline for positive coworkers to come back to work<br><br>u/LilyMooCow<br><br>This is exactly the problem with them and the CDC. They are being inconsistent and aren't even trying to hide it. I can't expect to the public to trust the CDC when they seem to change the rules to fit their staffing problem. It just give people "proof" that covid is overblown.<br><br>u/IrreverantUsername [MD]<br><br>Anyone noticing a trend with recent guidance from the AHA, CDC, etc? Clearly healthcare workers' health and lives don't matter.<br><br>u/mcgianni [Paramedic]<br><br>CDC is the first thing that came to mind, "masks do not work" and staff being suspended by hospitals for wearing them at the beginning of the pandemic<br><br>u/forgivemytypos [PA]<br><br>Right and maybe you'll do fine with covid, but there's also your family and your other patients that you interact with. And since the CDC says don't do any post exposure testing until you're symptomatic, that could be 100s of people you spread it to from that one guy that died despite giving him CPR 25 seconds sooner than getting the right PPE first</blockquote>  Reminder: this is in a discussion of how the <em>AHA</em> screwed up. <blockquote>u/Status-Gap3200<br><br>I am beginning to lose trust in the former revered U.S. institutions. I am most dissapointed in the former global powerhouse CDC.<br><br>u/decorticate_chimp [MD]<br><br>Up next: CDC recommends healthcare workers donate one of their functioning lungs to COVID patients in respiratory failure.</blockquote>  There are two additional things which have thrown gasoline on the pyre of what was left of the esteem Meddit once held for the CDC.<br><br>One,  which was alluded to in the above memes, is the impression that the CDC is subordinating individual safety to indulge corporate interests.  It's one thing if the CDC were risking ED and ICU staff lives to keep <em>hospitals</em> open. That at least has a plausibly noble motive.  But to help corporations <em>make money</em>? <br><br>As u/KunnFayyaKunn <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nursing/comments/rqi2it/comment/hqb67dn/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">put it</a> on r/nursing: <blockquote>This sub should definitely be listening, without question and uncritically, to the CDC, whose guidelines change according to *checks notes* the CEO of Delta airlines.<br><br><a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FHsnHoAXsAU87S4?format=jpg&amp;name=large">https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FHsnHoAXsAU87S4?format=jpg&amp;name=large</a></blockquote>  Yeah, that happened:<br><br>2021 Dec 21: Business Insider: "<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/delta-asking-cdc-to-shorten-quarantine-breakthrough-covid-19-cases-2021-12">Delta Air Lines is asking the CDC to consider shortening the isolation period for breakthrough COVID-19 cases due to its impact on workforce, operations</a>" by Huileng Tan.<br><br>How do we know this?  Was there a leak?  A whistleblower?  Nope: Delta issued a press release bragging on it.<br><br>2021 Dec 21: news.delta.com: "<a href="https://news.delta.com/delta-asks-cdc-consider-latest-scientific-data-shorten-covid-19-isolation-period">Delta asks CDC to consider latest scientific data to shorten COVID-19 isolation period</a>".<br><br>The optics, as the kids say these days, are appalling.<br><br>Ironically, there's very little chance that anything Delta Airline said to the CDC changed policy a mere two days later.  But by gum, Delta has managed to sure make it look like it did.  That said, I've heard people on Reddit respond to this observation with comments to the effect of "Delta just said the quiet part out loud, I'm sure other corporations were already saying these things behind closed doors."<br><br>Which is not an unreasonable surmise, given that, in the face of all this outrage, the CDC, in the person of Walensky, and Fauci, have doubled down, issuing statements that have been widely taken as affirming that the CDC has organized its recommendations around protecting the economy at the expense of worker safety.<br><br>This of course outraged the leftish spaces on Reddit, which are naturally very pro-worker.  But it didn't do anything to improve the impression of the CDC held by medical professionals, who as establishment-mainstream as they tend to be, were nevertheless confronting explicit CDC "guidance" to their employers that said those employers could reduce isolation periods for COVID positive staff further on the grounds of <em>staffing shortages</em>.  So now comments show up on r/medicine like this one by u/sbattistella [Nurse]:<blockquote>Alternate title: The CDC Bows Down to Wall Street<br><br>Seriously. They are seeing the Omicron numbers and freaking the fuck out about the economy.</blockquote> And I have to stop to check I'm on Meddit and not in r/antiwork.  <br><br>The other thing that made things worse was how terribly the CDC handled communicating their new "guidance". The starter comment from the OP (u/saitouamaya [MPH, Epidemiology]) who posted the CDC link to r/medicine in the first place <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/rq0in4/comment/hq7j0aq/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">says</a> <blockquote>My afternoon has been a clusterfuck because as usual, CDC gave no heads up to state and local health departments about this change. I found out on CNN.</blockquote> The following discussion ensues, revealing an absolute sea-change in public sentiment on Meddit: <blockquote>u/cubdawg [MD]<br><br>I’m really over the CDC right now.<br><br>u/saitouamaya OP [MPH, Epidemiology]<br><br>You and me both. There was a time not so long ago when I had starry eyes and aspired to one day be an epidemiologist at the CDC. Not so much anymore. And I know a lot of my fellow epis feel the same way.<br><br>u/runningdivorcee<br><br>Fellow MPH Epi, totally disgusted. When they dropped mask recs, we all knew the anti masker/vaxxers would not follow the rules. Now they’ll just go around proclaiming to be asymptomatic. This pandemic proves that people can not and will not do the right thing.<br><br>u/mcgianni [Paramedic]<br><br>I mean, they told people to get vaccinated so they don't have to wear a mask, with the hidden message that vaccines are effective because they prevent infection. and here we are now, mistrust in vaccines, CDC and medicine as a whole.

I’m not done with existential crisis that comes from being unable to trust the CDC and everything that means.<br><br>u/DrMursePA-C<br><br>Welcome to hell.<br><br>If you think covid is a crock of shit, at least you arent afraid of one half of the public health apparatus and covid situation. If you follow the most stringent guidelines, at least you trust the experts. Either way, you believe in something.<br><br>If you think covid is very real, and very scary, and also that the CDC doesn't really have a good handle on what's going on, and that the government is just kind of asleep at the wheel, its a nightmare.<br><br>u/nevernotdating [PhD]<br><br>Kind of crazy that we are now in year 3 of this pandemic and the CDC is still shooting from the hip, under administrations from both parties no less!<br><br>The fact that neither Biden nor Trump can/could tackle COVID appropriately portends a dark future for our country.<br><br>u/StrongMedicine [Hospitalist]<br><br>One of the most shocking things of this pandemic has been how thoroughly the CDC and FDA have both lost all credibility.<br><br>As already pointed out, it's not just one of the administrations or one director.

Don't agree with THIS CDC guideline but if we are throwing the baby our with the bath water then I guess I shouldn't get vaxed or mask up. Is that where we are going with this?<br><br>Seems like all the subs who want to discredit or sway nurses just got their open door to make us all distrust CDC again. Congrats to them. But to be clear you'll never make me selfish asshole cause political money hit the CDC. [...]</blockquote>That was posted in response to the "The CDC stands for Can't Disrupt Capitalism" meme on r/nursing, and was downvoted into oblivion, which is refreshing I must say.<br><br>For a sense of how much attitudes have changed, just seven days ago someone on r/nursing <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nursing/comments/rlvx8b/even_my_therapist/">posted about having a bad experience with a therapist</a> who was apparently somewhat COVID-skeptical, and said they were now "looking for a new clinician who knows to trust the goddamn CDC."  This not only received no pushback, it got a commiserating comment, "This morning, two of my coworkers loudly proclaimed that they do not trust Fauci while we were waiting for shift pre-brief. My friend and I looked at each other with WTF in our eyes. I just do not fucking get it."<br><br>So the forum has gone from "of course all right thinking people trust the CDC; indeed trusting the CDC is synonymous with taking a reasonable, science-based attitude towards COVID" to "burn those unscientific motherfucking corporate lap dogs at the CDC to the ground" in about 5 days, three of which were a holiday weekend.<br><br>Because while the general tenor of things on r/medicine is aghast and disgusted and disappointed, the tenor of things on r/nursing is <strong>enraged</strong>.  When I checked on late Tuesday, something like 75% to 95% of content on r/nursing under "Hot" was about the AHA and CDC, and it ranged from memes like the above to this epic screed about the AHA, itself: "<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nursing/comments/rqhp7t/the_american_heart_association_the_most_shameless/">The American Heart Association: the most shameless and disgusting grift in healthcare history</a>".<br><br>Now that it's become socially acceptable to express criticism of the CDC on Meddit, I've noticed that healthcare workers are bringing up beefs from the past that were blown off or greeted with hostility by their peers, if they even dared utter them.  A bunch of the previously quoted comments exemplify that - "I'm still mad about the whole 'surgical masks are fine to take care of acutely ill hospitalized COVID+ patients' mess from March or April 2020", an issue which a different commenter, an EMT,  in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/rn87cp/comment/hprqcnl/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">another discussion</a> on r/medicine about the CDC guidance, referred to as "bandana-gate"(!).  In another thread on that post, an unflaired user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/rn87cp/comment/hprnxl9/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">said</a>: <blockquote>[...] The CDC has failed us, see this sub and any other science sub to see how they have flailed around for the last two years. [...]</blockquote> Which: no, you won't find much discussion of how the CDC failed healthcare workers, or the general public, in that sub or any other science sub over the previous two years, because it was mostly ruthlessly suppressed by community norms, which have only now been abandoned.<br><br><hr width="25%" align="center"><br><br>While I was writing this, I became aware that Katelyn Jetelina, blogger Your Local Epidemiologist on Substack (<a href="https://siderea.dreamwidth.org/1730925.html">previously</a>), <a href="https://yourlocalepidemiologist.substack.com/p/state-of-affairs-dec-28">had just posted her own reaction to the CDC guidance change</a>  (all emphasis in the original): <blockquote>The CDC said they changed this due to changing scientific evidence: “The majority of SARS-CoV-2 transmission occurs early in the course of illness, generally in the 1-2 days prior to onset of symptoms and the 2-3 days after.”<br><br>I, like many other scientists, have many reactions to this guidance. For what it’s worth, here are some of mine:<br><br>1.    <b><i>What is the evidence?</i></b> The CDC didn’t provide the scientific evidence backing their decision, which was incredibly disappointing.</blockquote> She then goes on to explain what evidence she <em>does</em> have at her disposal, and how it would lead her to make a different decision: <blockquote>[...] Unvaccinated people clear the virus in 7.5 days, which is obviously higher than the 5-day clock with this guidance. Even more worrisome is the broad range of infectious periods for unvaccinated, which ranged from 2 to 14 days (see panel G below). This new guidance may not be a problem if the unvaccinated actually wear a mask 5 days after isolation like this guidance suggests. But I doubt this will happen. <b><i>The CDC stretched the science for unvaccinated people too far.</i></b></blockquote>  Her criticisms do not end there.  Click through to read it all yourself.<br><br><hr width="25%" align="center"><br><br>I'm in a really weird position with all this.  Two weird positions, actually.<br> <br>It's kind of nice to see the walls of denial and professional codependence finally come down and people – fellow medical professionals, scientists, the pro-vaccine public – finally, <em>finally</em> to start to realize many of the things I've been pointing out about the CDC all along.  I mean better late than never.<br><br>And I've been having conversations about how we listen to what the CDC says that I've not previously been able to have in the spaces where I've been having them, which has been surreal and pleasant.<br><br>But that said, hilariously, <strong>I</strong> don't actually think the CDC's guidance change is actually all that wrong.  Just based on what I know of the what science I've seen.<br><br>That's weird position number one.  Weird position number two is what I read in my tea leaves.<br><br>Instead of merely comparing the evidence we have to the CDC's decision and noting where they don't line up, and saying the CDC got it wrong, we can do the reverse operation: we can look at the CDC's behavior, and project backwards to what evidence they might have, and not yet disclosed, that would make their current behavior make sense.  We could speculate as to what the CDC might be thinking that would make their behavior make sense.<br><br>Part of my art, longtime readers may have noticed, is reading between the lines and, crucially, noticing what is <strong>missing</strong>.  And there is a big, <em>whopper</em> of a hole right now in what the CDC is telling us and in the entire scientific discourse around omicron.<br><br>And that hole is omicron's R0.<br><br>Apparently we don't have one.  Not officially.  Not yet.  I've found googling "omicron R0" an interesting exercise.<br><br>2021 Dec 17: Lancet Respiratory Medicine "News" (<strong>not</strong> a research article): "<a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanres/article/PIIS2213-2600(21)00559-2/fulltext#articleInformation">Omicron variant and booster COVID-19 vaccines</a>" by Talha Khan Burki: <blockquote>[...] The original strain of SARS-CoV-2 has an R0 of 2·5, while the delta variant (B.1.617.2) has an R0 of just under 7. Martin Hibberd, professor of emerging infectious diseases at London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine (London, UK), reckons omicron's R0 could be as high as 10.</blockquote> Everything I've been seeing about omicron's R0 has been similarly informal; some of it claims omicron is "many times more contagious" than delta.  Which, looking at charts of its spread, <em>does</em> seem plausible.<br><br>I've heard things – rumors, really, so take with a whole cup of salt – like "as contagious as measles".<br><br>Measles is the worst case scenario.  (Or rather, the worst case scenario <em>so far</em>.)  Measles is, to my knoweldge, the most contagious airborne disease we know of.  It has an R0 of 16.  There are substantiated cases of people catching measles from <em>passing through a space</em>  that <em>two hours previously</em> had had some one with measles in it.<br><br>So I've been wondering if the CDC is sitting on evidence of a <em>really</em> high R0.<br><br>Because I do think there is an R0 value high enough – I don't know what that number is, but I'm sure there is one – where it stops making sense trying to keep from catching it.  There comes a point where trying to keep from catching it is so difficult, and implausible to accomplish, that it makes more sense to just focus on surviving it.  There is a point where contracting the disease is pretty much inevitable, so pursuing general infection control has such diminishing returns, it's not worth it.  Maybe that's what the CDC is looking at.<br><br>All of this is just speculation, but it would fit with what evidence I <em>do</em> have, and explain the observed behavior of the CDC.<br><br>So, weirdly enough, I might actually agree with the CDC if I had the evidence they have.  If they have reason to believe that omicron is unstoppable maybe it makes sense to stop trying so hard to stop it.<br><br>Their "guidance" might reflect less a policy <em>decision</em> weighing the pros and cons of different approaches to slowing the spread and flattening the curve, than a capitulation to inexorable exigencies.  If R0 is high enough, there may not be at this point any meaningful decision left to make.<br><br><hr width="25%" align="center"><br><br>I still haven't told you what <em>I</em> think is wrong with the CDC.  I've never told anybody what I think is wrong with the CDC.  I'm not about to tell you now.  It's a long, long story, and I've been working on that post, and its factored out spin-off posts, off and on since May of 2020.<br><br>I will say this: everybody else seems to be trying to figure out what is wrong with the CDC <em>as an institution</em>.  I look at the CDC and go, "Oh, that.  Yeah, that's a pretty severe case of what I've been noticing infecting all of medicine in the US, and a lot of other places too."<br><br>I can't actually talk about what I see in the CDC without criticizing all of medicine, and by "medicine" I don't just mean the healthcare system and its institutions, I actually do mean the community of practice that is medicine: the actual doctors and nurses and therapists and epidemiologists all the rest of the people that treat patients and study disease and <em>are</em> medicine.<br><br>And unfortunately those are the people who are most harmed right now.  Criticizing them is not at all what I feel like doing.  It is too much like blaming the victim; and even if it's not that, I think there are a lot of medical providers who are way, way too raw right now to not take it that way anyways.<br><br>But the problems in the CDC – the really serious, deep problems - are not because of "politics", in the sense of national politics, or which administration is in charge.  They are problems with medicine itself.<br><br><div style="text-align:center">

<div class="comment-content">I remember sometime early-ish in 2020, someone I follow here who worked for Public Health England making an argument against lockdown, at around the time that an early lockdown might have remained short. I think one difficulty with the current medical paradigm is that "evidence-based medicine" is sometimes at odds with the precautionary principle. Another conflict I see is that what works well on a population level may be horrible on an individual level.<br><br>I have enough friends with chronic undiagnosed healthcrap, and enough of my own healthcrap that is difficult to diagnose partly *because* I take steps to self-treat, that I am pretty cynical about official guidelines for diagnosis and treatment. <div class="edittime"><em>Edited (tyops) <span class="datetime"><span class="comment-date-text">Date: </span> <span title="">2021-12-31 10:01 am (UTC)</span></span></em></div></div></div>

I would expect it to be more like measles in the Americas during colonisation, or maybe the Faroese outbreak several decades ago. <br><br>Another thing that strikes me as possible justification for shorter quarantine duration might be around viral load and disease severity. If the R0 is so high that everyone is going to get it, then it might make sense to try and make sure everyone gets a "mild" case. I am not convinced that this would be a prudent strategy, because of a) increased likelihood of new variants in a high-transmission environment and b) unknown long term effects from mild infection. </div></div>
