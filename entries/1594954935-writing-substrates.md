# Writing Substrates

I mentioned in my [introduction](/introduction/) that I have a lot of places to write already, but they all feel pretty different. I realize that I've never actually tried to define how each substrate for writing feels, so this is an attempt to take a look at how I interact with each of the places I write, and what works well and doesn't work well about each of them.

### [Notebook](https://notebook.wesleyac.com)

* Nontechnical
* Longform writing
* Audience feels small, I can write about things that feel personal
* Writing every day, so I expect many of my posts to be bad
@sidenote: Like this one!

### [Main Blog](https://blog.wesleyac.com)

* Technical
* Longform writing
* Audience feels large, often gets posted to HN or Lobste.rs
* Infrequent posts, trying to be high-quality

### [thoughts](https://glit.sh/~wesleyac/thoughts/)

* Short snippets
* Audience feels small
* It's like twitter, but nobody can @ me
* No RSS feed, so people have to explicitly go to the page if they want to see new thoughts. This makes it feel safe to post dumb/unimportant/asinine things, since it's peoples own fault if they go and look for it.
* Lots of [my friends have thoughts pages as well](https://gist.github.com/WesleyAC/0796e0624def2b3543ed2104a3277f23) which is pretty cute

### [Twitter](https://twitter.com/WAptekar)

* Lots of followers, but I'm not sure what they want me to tweet?
    * Lots of tech bro followers, this is probably my main audience unfortunately
    * Lots of [Recurse Center](https://recurse.com) people
    * Some people who I have crushes on and want to think I'm cool
    * Some people who I know in person and apparently decided to follow me based on that
    * Some of my coworkers‽
* Random people can @ me
* There are lots of cool people who I want to be friends with but that seems hard to make happen if you aren't Extremely Online

### [Twitter alt](https://twitter.com/otherwesley)

* Good place for feelings and opinions that will get me cancelled
* A few friends who will reply to things I post
* Pretty good!
* I wish a few more people followed me

### Mailing list

I started a mailing list a while ago. I wrote the software myself so it's very cumbersome to use and I sent one post with it and had to deal with Gmail spam filtering and just sort of stopped. I would like to get back to it, but my focus is on my notebook right now.

### [Recurse Center Zulip](https://www.recurse.com/blog/112-how-rc-uses-zulip)

The Recurse Centers Zulip chat instance has lots of stream that I like, but I have a particular affinity for `#consciousness`,
@sidenote: The "stream of consciousness," get it? It's very funny :)
where every person has their own thread for talking about whatever's on their mind. There's a sort of community, where people will respond to each others posts, but the community is small and nice enough that feels good.

I don't really have a conclusion here — it's mostly just nice to think about where I have to write and what makes different places nice. One thing that I want more of is writing in small communities, where I get comments from a consistent and friendly group of people. But right now, I think I'll just focus on my notebook. I've been getting nice comments from friends already, and it's been really satisfying to write so far.
