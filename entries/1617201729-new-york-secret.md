# A New York Secret

Go into Brooklyn, past DeKalb Ave. Get on a Manhattan-bound Q train. I find the effect is best when you're slightly drunk, returning home at 3am from a house party in Flatbush, but it'll work at any time. Find a seat on the left-hand side of the train, facing towards the opposite wall of the train car. Sit back, and enjoy.
