# A Few NYC Places

## <span class="placename">[Mmuseumm](https://www.mmuseumm.com/)</span> <span class="location">4 Cortlandt Alley, Manhattan</span>

A museum contained entirely within a freight elevator â€” its collection changes periodically, but is always bizarre.


## <span class="placename">[Bluestockings](https://bluestockings.com/)</span> <span class="location">116 Suffolk St, Manhattan</span>

One of the best bookstores in town, and a nice spot to hang out and meet all the cool art queers.

## <span class="placename">[Dream House](https://www.melafoundation.org/)</span> <span class="location">275 Church St, Manhattan</span>

Pink lights. A constant droning noise. Incense. Pillows and carpet. What more can you ask for?

## <span class="placename">[Wonderville](https://www.wonderville.nyc/)</span> <span class="location">1186 Broadway, Brooklyn</span>

Barcade where all the cool indie arcade cabinets live. The spot to get your Killer Queen in once you've quit your miserable Google job. Also the bouncer was chill and let me in after I showed him my ID that said I was underage so that's neat?

## <span class="placename">[Unnameable books](https://unnameablebooks.blogspot.com/)</span> <span class="location">600 Vanderbilt Ave, Brooklyn</span>

Mostly used, but excellently pretentious nonetheless. Probably the second best bookstore in town. Also right next to Ample Hills, as a bonus. <span style="font-size:45%;vertical-align:middle;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(just ignore the whole "Steve Jobs Of Ice Cream" [thing](https://marker.medium.com/the-shocking-meltdown-of-ample-hills-brooklyns-hottest-ice-cream-company-66b27dc1791d))</span>

## <span class="placename">[Cactus Store](http://www.hotcactus.nyc/)</span> <span class="location">5 Essex St, Manhattan</span>

If you're interested in buying a cactus you've come to the right place.
