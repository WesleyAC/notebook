There's a certain naïve optimism that one sees looking at the early hypertext movement. If we simply let everyone communicate, connect the world, [give people tools](https://lord.io/blog/2020/tools-0/), surely all the world's problems will be solved — the arc of progress inevitable, steadily marching forwards.

One can plainly see that this account of the world fails on two fronts: creating connections between people is [not fundamentally progressive](https://webcomicname.com/post/633063407862546432), and tools to do so exist primarily at the whim of capital, rather than that of utility. The 80s dreams of hypertext have dried up — the Web, extant and profitable, was enough to dampen any momentum towards loftier goals.

A common reaction to this realization is a return to tradition, whether it's [Gopher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gopher_%28protocol%29), [XMPP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XMPP), [IRC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat), or something else. But a return to tradition is just a more conservative way of abandoning dreams of something better — many of the early dreams of hypertext remain unrealized today.
