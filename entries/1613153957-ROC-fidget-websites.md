# Fidget Websites

If you, like me, have trouble focusing while you're on a call, one thing that can help is using websites to doodle while you're listening. This does the same thing in my brain that fidgeting usually does, but I find it more effective to be fidgeting with something on a screen, to prevent me from trying to multitask while I'm on a call. I especially like [weavesilk.com](http://weavesilk.com/) for this, but I also sometimes use [SuperSym](https://supersym.briankardon.net/), [Sandspiel](https://sandspiel.club/), [Mutsuacen](https://mutsuacen.com/), and [bomomo](https://bomomo.com/) for this sort of thing.

Do you also have fidgeting websites? If so, I'm curious which ones you use!
