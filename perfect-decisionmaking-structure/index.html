This has the very good property that you don’t end up in standstills, and it’s always obvious who needs to be convinced in order to make something happen. However, this requires the person at the top of the org chart to fundamentally have all the power<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="sn-2"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="sn-2" type="checkbox"><span class="sidenote">And don’t give me that shit about the CEO being accountable to the board — that’s true, but those people are just playing a completely different game, and when it comes down to it oligarchy isn’t much better than monarchy.</span>, which is in almost all cases more power than any individual should have.</section><section><h2 id="direct-democracy">Direct Democracy</h2><p>Direct democracy is another common way to make decisions. It’s pretty good for small organizations, but it has a few problems:<ul><li>It requires everyone to have context on decisions that they’re voting on (or to opt out of voting)<li>There can easily be a case where there are several factions, and whichever faction is the majority gets to make all of the decisions.</ul></section><section><h2 id="representative-democracy">Representative Democracy</h2><p>Representative democracy fixes the first problem above, but does nothing for the second one, and also creates a bunch of other problems, including centralization of power. It’s also typically slower to respond to misuse of power than direct democracy.</section><section><h2 id="consensus">Consensus</h2><p>Consensus decisionmaking can be good for small groups, but it suffers the obvious problem that if you can’t reach consensus, you end up at a standstill, with no clear path forward.<hr><p>Given all that, let’s look at the properties that I want:<ul><li>Non-hierarchical — this prevents centralization and misuse of power.<li>Proportional — that is, 50% + 1 of the group shouldn’t be able to make <em>all</em> of the decisions.<li>Avoids deadlocks — it should always be possible to come to a decision.<li>Obvious — it should be clear how a decision will be made.</ul><p>There’s a very simple system that meets these requirements: decisions are made by consensus, but if consensus can’t be reached then a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sortition">random person</a> is picked to make the decision. Here’s how I imagine this working in, for instance, a small company:<ul><li>People are free to make whatever changes they want, as long as they announce what they’re doing.<li>If anyone has a concern about what someone is doing, they start a conversation about those concerns.<li>People talk it out and attempt to come to a consensus.<li>If a consensus can’t be reached, someone can call for a sortition, and a random person will be selected to make a decision.</ul><p>This seems like a pretty good solution for a lot of groups.</section><section style="text-align:center;padding-top:50px"><p style="font-size:120px;color:#444"><a href="/" class="no-tufte-underline">☙</a></section><section><details class="changelog"><summary class="summarytoggle" title="Changelog"><picture><img alt="changelog" src="/icons/history.svg"></picture></summary><div><time datetime="2021-06-21T21:39:56-0700">21 Jun 2021</time>: <a href="https://github.com/wesleyac/notebook/commit/1f3d28852d051f91d00a15f25ea1b0de6f9d6262">Add "Perfect Decisionmaking Structure" entry.</a></div><div><time datetime="2021-06-21T22:40:44-0700">21 Jun 2021</time>: <a href="https://github.com/wesleyac/notebook/commit/4cea1b290d06749bf7bd1bbfac4ca9a9ae4e8a9c">Fix typo.</a></div></details></section></article>
