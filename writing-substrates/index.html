I realize that I’ve never actually tried to define how each substrate for writing feels, so this is an attempt to take a look at how I interact with each of the places I write, and what works well and doesn’t work well about each of them.<h3 id="notebook"><a href="https://notebook.wesleyac.com">Notebook</a></h3><ul><li>Nontechnical<li>Longform writing<li>Audience feels small, I can write about things that feel personal<li>Writing every day, so I expect many of my posts to be bad<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="sn-1"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="sn-1" type="checkbox"><span class="sidenote">Like this one!</span></ul><h3 id="main-blog"><a href="https://blog.wesleyac.com">Main Blog</a></h3><ul><li>Technical<li>Longform writing<li>Audience feels large, often gets posted to HN or Lobste.rs<li>Infrequent posts, trying to be high-quality</ul><h3 id="thoughts"><a href="https://glit.sh/~wesleyac/thoughts/">thoughts</a></h3><ul><li>Short snippets<li>Audience feels small<li>It’s like twitter, but nobody can @ me<li>No RSS feed, so people have to explicitly go to the page if they want to see new thoughts.

I wrote the software myself so it’s very cumbersome to use and I sent one post with it and had to deal with Gmail spam filtering and just sort of stopped. I would like to get back to it, but my focus is on my notebook right now.<h3 id="recurse-center-zulip"><a href="https://www.recurse.com/blog/112-how-rc-uses-zulip">Recurse Center Zulip</a></h3><p>The Recurse Center’s Zulip chat instance has lots of streams that I like, but I have a particular affinity for <code>#consciousness</code>,<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="sn-2"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="sn-2" type="checkbox"><span class="sidenote">The “stream of consciousness,” get it?

There’s a sort of community, where people will respond to each other’s posts, but the community is small and nice enough that feels good.</section><section><p>I don’t really have a conclusion here — it’s mostly just nice to think about where I have to write and what makes different places nice. One thing that I want more of is writing in small communities, where I get comments from a consistent and friendly group of people. But right now, I think I’ll just focus on my notebook. I’ve been getting nice comments from friends already, and it’s been really satisfying to write so far.</section><section style="text-align:center;padding-top:50px"><p style="font-size:120px;color:#444"><a href="/" class="no-tufte-underline">☙</a></section><section><details class="changelog"><summary class="summarytoggle" title="Changelog"><picture><img alt="changelog" src="/icons/history.svg"></picture></summary><div><time datetime="2020-07-17T00:06:24-0400">17 Jul 2020</time>: <a href="https://github.com/wesleyac/notebook/commit/2c62ed0f9caa8ec6f513aacaa36a9ceb6d5715c6">add "writing substrates" entry</a></div><div><time datetime="2020-07-17T00:16:47-0400">17 Jul 2020</time>: <a href="https://github.com/wesleyac/notebook/commit/3dd1b72c33a187f25166957ddc5b00c493cc04a2">fix typos</a></div><div><time datetime="2020-07-17T00:28:07-0400">17 Jul 2020</time>: <a href="https://github.com/wesleyac/notebook/commit/229a7d25fd97be1cb7e0c6775620cbdd390b7c24">fix typos</a></div></details></section></article>
