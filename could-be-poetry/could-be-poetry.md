# A few things that could be poetry

* The right combination of street signs, viewed from a artful vantage point
* Words on bit of packaging, torn to reveal and conceal as needed
* The output of a command line tool, perhaps unexpectedly
* Overheard words, drifting along, liberated from their initial context
* A form, at first appearing bureaucratic, revealing humanity on deeper reflection
* An idea, if you consider it divine enough
