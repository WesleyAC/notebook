People typically use the word reactionary to describe a specific set of right-wing, conservative<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="sn-1"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="sn-1" type="checkbox"><span class="sidenote">“conservative” is another word that’s interesting in the same way “reactionary” is — it’s sometimes used as almost a synonym for “republican,” but environmentalists, for instance, are literally “conservative” in that they want to conserve something that exists. It’s useful to realize this distinction, so that you have the ability talk about ideas being conservative separately from their moral valance.</span> politics, but it can be much more broad than that. I would define an idea as “reactionary” if, rather than being constructed from a set of abstract principles, it’s constructed primarily in opposition to some other idea. An idea being reactionary has no fundamental relationship to being good, but realizing that an idea is reactionary (and identifying the thing that it exists in reaction to) can help you better understand it.<p>The standard way that people use the term “reactionary” is to describe a political philosophy that is in reaction to things like civil rights, social justice, etc. In this case, it’s pretty clear that the ideas being reacted to (racism is bad, women deserve equal rights, etc) are good ideas, and thus this version of reactionary philosophy is bad.<p>There are less clear-cut cases, though. For instance, I recently launched <a href="https://thoughts.page/">a project</a> that is essentially a reactionary anti-twitter, anti-socialmedia website. I mostly didn’t make the <a href="/art-and-engineering/#1.Lgte24DNa:203.G3OBKEVNZ:338">design decisions</a> that I did because I thought that they were fundamentally philosophically correct, I made them because I wanted to demonstrate what a place that attempts to be the opposite of twitter along a particular axis looked like.<p>I was reminded this again when <a href="https://recurse.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/26440-small-questions/topic/another.20phrase.20for.20.22from.20first.20principles.22/near/262660694">thinking about</a><label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="sn-2"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="sn-2" type="checkbox"><span class="sidenote">This link will only work for members of the <a href="https://www.recurse.com/">Recurse Center</a> community, sorry. The relevant section of the linked post reads:<br><br>“hmmm, i think one property that i think about when people say something is “from first principles” is that it goes into a level of detail about fundamental abstractions that is uncharacteristic of traditional ways of teaching the subject. so, what “first principles” are sort of depends on what the typical way of teaching the subject is.”</span> the idea of explaining things “from first principles” — describing something as being “from first principles” is typically in contrast to a traditional way that subject is taught, and is thus a fundamentally reactionary idea. This can be good in some cases (when the traditional way of teaching is insufficient or leads to confusion), but bad in others (when the traditional way of teaching is actually pedagogically sound).<p>It’s also probably useful to take a look at examples of ideas that <em>aren’t</em> reactionary<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="sn-3"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="sn-3" type="checkbox"><span class="sidenote">Or at least, are less reactionary — ideas are never created in a vacuum, and every idea exists in a tangled web of literature. “Reactionary,” like almost every label, is not actually a binary, but complex multivariate spectrum.</span> — for instance, one thing that is pleasing to me about anarchist political philosophy<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="sn-4"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="sn-4" type="checkbox"><span class="sidenote">If you want an intro to anarchist political philosophy, I’d probably recommend <em>Two Cheers for Anarchism</em> by James C.
