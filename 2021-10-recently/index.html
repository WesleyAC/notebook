I’d been, like many other people, mostly taking a break from dating for the past two years or so. Now that I’m thinking about getting back into it, I’m trying to reevaluate what I’m looking for, how to think about the process, and other such things.<p>My high-level views haven’t changed much — <a href="https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/andie-nordgren-the-short-instructional-manifesto-for-relationship-anarchy"><em>The short instructional manifesto for relationship anarchy</em></a> pretty well describes a lot of my leanings, but some more subtle details about what I’m searching and hoping for have changed.<p><input class="margin-toggle" id="mn-2" type="checkbox"> <span class="marginnote"><picture><source srcset="/img/post/2021-10-recently/pixie-cup-lichen.webp" type="image/webp"><source srcset="/img/post/2021-10-recently/pixie-cup-lichen.jpg" type="image/jpeg"><img alt="Some pixie cup lichen." src="/img/post/2021-10-recently/pixie-cup-lichen.jpg"></picture></span><p>I think probably the biggest thing that I’m placing more importance on at the moment is having relationships that can survive being distant for a while, and come back just as strong. While there’s something to be said for making commitments, my life is currently structured in a way where I often end up running off to focus on something alone for a few months at a time every so often, so I’m trying to focus on relationships that are compatible with that sort of lifestyle.<p><picture><source srcset="/img/post/2021-10-recently/ausable-chasm-2.webp" type="image/webp"><source srcset="/img/post/2021-10-recently/ausable-chasm-2.jpg" type="image/jpeg"><img alt="A view of a river running through a chasm." src="/img/post/2021-10-recently/ausable-chasm-2.jpg"></picture><p>In terms of technical projects, I have a few things going on.<p>I spent a while thinking through (and prototyping) a linux distribution that I’d describe as being like NixOS but without a custom programming language, and like Qubes but with namespaces instead of VMs. The idea was to use <code>.deb</code> packages, and use overlayfs and bind mounts to allow for installing multiple versions of the same package, instead of nixos-style <code>$PATH</code> hacks. This “works,” but overlayfs doesn’t like really big stacks of overlays, and has some pretty weird failure modes once you start pushing the limits of things. I still think this is a good idea overall, but I’m not planning on pursuing it more at the moment.<p><input class="margin-toggle" id="mn-3" type="checkbox"> <span class="marginnote"><picture><source srcset="/img/post/2021-10-recently/tree-mushrooms.webp" type="image/webp"><source srcset="/img/post/2021-10-recently/tree-mushrooms.jpg" type="image/jpeg"><img alt="Mushrooms growing on a tree." src="/img/post/2021-10-recently/tree-mushrooms.jpg"></picture></span><p>I paired with someone on a pretty early <a href="https://cryptopals.com/">cryptopals</a> challenge, which got me sucked back into working on them myself. I <a href="https://github.com/wesleyac/cryptopals">left off</a> halfway through set five in late 2019, and picked back up. I forgot how much fun this sort of thing is, I was pretty immediately sucked in and just started working on it all day. So far I’ve implemented some attacks on SRP, and am in the middle of RSA stuff now. I’ve been feeling a bit melancholy about the state of crypto — I really love falling down the abstract math rabbit hole, but knowing that it has important and practical applications, but so much of crypto these days is cryptocurrency bullshit. I just want to do math to stop surveillance, but so many people in the crypto community are just doing boring blockchain scams. I was talking to a friend about ZKPs, and I realized that when I first read about them, they were impractical but exciting. Since then, they’ve become practical (via SNARKS and similar), but I forgot about the excitement, since most of the applications I see these days are cryptocurrency, which is, on the whole, a pretty boring application of ZKPs.<p>I’ve also more generally been wanting to see more reality-based writing about cryptocurrency. I think that almost the entire field is bad, but most of the critiques of cryptocurrencies/NFTs/etc are very lazy and not technically-grounded. Paul Butler’s recent article “<a href="https://paulbutler.org/2021/betting-against-bitcoin/">Betting Against Bitcoin</a>” is an example of the sort of thing I’d like to see more of.<p><picture><source srcset="/img/post/2021-10-recently/bridge-closed.webp" type="image/webp"><source srcset="/img/post/2021-10-recently/bridge-closed.jpg" type="image/jpeg"><img alt="A sign reading 'BRIDGE CLOSED,' in front of a river with one concrete pillar in the middle that appears to have once upon a time supported a bridge.

The first study to test this in 1971<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="sn-4"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="sn-4" type="checkbox"><span class="sidenote"><a href="https://doi.fail/10.1007/bf00422612">DOI: 10.1007/BF00422612</a></span> wrote that their sample size was so small because “5-HTP is exceedingly expensive,” which was presumably the case in 1971, but definitely is no longer true — no one has run the study with a larger sample size since, though.<p>The other thing I’ve been looking into is genome sequencing — it makes sense to me that healthcare providers having access to full-genome sequences of patients could allow them to prescribe treatments more effectively,<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="sn-5"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="sn-5" type="checkbox"><span class="sidenote">I’m also trying to be mindful of the fact that many things are not genetic, and historically there have been many places where people have overstated the impact of genetics, to disastrous consequences.

I don’t have a lot of thoughts on this yet, but I’ve been looking into getting my genome sequenced and writing some code to deal with all the data, which seems like a pretty reasonable place to start.<p><picture><source srcset="/img/post/2021-10-recently/ausable-chasm-house-waterfall.webp" type="image/webp"><source srcset="/img/post/2021-10-recently/ausable-chasm-house-waterfall.jpg" type="image/jpeg"><img alt="A river with a small house on the bank that has a pipe coming out of it, with water falling into the river." src="/img/post/2021-10-recently/ausable-chasm-house-waterfall.jpg"></picture><p>Over the past few months, I’ve been reflecting on the extent to which gendered socialization as children can affect people’s personalities into adulthood. At risk of being overly reductive, I think many kids in the United States are largely taught or implicitly expected to fit into either hyper-masculinity or hyper-femininity, and then find that their process of becoming a whole person as an adult is primarily the process of unlearning that socialization. This is hard to talk about, though, for a few reasons:<ul><li>It can be difficult to talk about gendered socialization while also respecting that that socialization may be very different from how someone sees themself.<li>Expectation around gender are very culturally dependent, even within the United States.<li>It’s unclear that thinking about this sort of thing in terms of gender is actually useful — I speculate that it probably is in many cases, but it could be that it more useful to break it down along other axes.</ul><p>Either way, though, I’ve been enjoying talking with a few friends about their gendered socialization, the ways in which that’s influenced them into adulthood, and which parts people want to hold on to and which they want to unlearn.<p><picture><source srcset="/img/post/2021-10-recently/baxter-mountain.webp" type="image/webp"><source srcset="/img/post/2021-10-recently/baxter-mountain.jpg" type="image/jpeg"><img alt="A view of fall foliage from the top of Baxter Mountain." src="/img/post/2021-10-recently/baxter-mountain.jpg"></picture><p>I’ve been reading a pretty good number of books this month:<ul><li><em>A Libertarian Walks Into a Bear</em> by Matthew Hongoltz-Hetling: This was a really, really excellent read. It’s mostly a history of both the Free Town Project and bears in the area around Grafton, NH. My understanding about the Free Town Project going into this book was very simplistic — some people tried a thing, it fell apart for unclear reasons. Now that I’ve read this book, I have a much better understanding of the details of how and why the project failed. This book also contains the best takedown of libertarianism I’ve seen — the chapter is “Unlocking Utopia,” and it stands well on its own if you’re interested in reading just that part of the book.<li><em>Evocative Objects</em> edited by Sherry Turkle: I first put this book on my list because the phrase “evocative object” popped into my head out of nowhere, so I searched for it and figured if there was a book about that it was probably worth giving a look. The thing that spurred me to actually read it, though, was a friend doing research on learning and pedagogy mentioning that they like Sherry Turkle’s work and writing a lot. I’m a bit more than halfway through, I’ve found it pretty enjoyable, although the essays are a little hit-or-miss.<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="sn-6"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="sn-6" type="checkbox"><span class="sidenote">Ones that stand out in my memory are: Carol Strohecker on Knots, Michelle Hlubinka on The Datebook, Irene Castle McLaughlin on The Bracelet, William J. Mitchell on The Melbourne Train, Trevor Pinch on The Synthesizer, and Stefan Helmreich on The SX-70 Instant Camera.</span><li><em>Polysecure</em> by Jessica Fern: I’m running a reading group for this<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="sn-7"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="sn-7" type="checkbox"><span class="sidenote">Let me know if you’re interested in joining!</span> — so far it’s been better than I expected: particularly, it took a lot of care to add caveats and nuance that is often lacking in writing about attachment styles. Part One is the best explanation of attachment styles that I’ve seen so far.<li><em>Cultish</em> by Amanda Montell: I saw this book at the Brooklyn Book Fair and picked it up on a whim — I expected it to be a little trashy, but I like trashy reading about cults, so I figured I’d give it a go. It surpassed my expectations by a huge margin — the thesis of the book is that the fundamental way that cults operate and exert control is via language, and it provides a lot of solid, albeit somewhat circumstantial evidence for that idea.<li><em>The Ones Who Stay And Fight</em> by N. K. Jemisin: I read this at the recommendation of a friend after re-reading <em>The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas</em> (which I absolutely love), and it gave me a lot to think about. I’m still processing it, but I definitely recommend it. (They’re both short stories, you could get through them both in probably less than an hour)<li><em>Debt</em> by David Graeber: I’m still working through this — it continues to be excellent, although I think I’ve probably gotten most of the most important details, and am hitting some diminishing returns. There are two bits that stand out in my memory. First, the connections between bridewealth, blood debt, and slavery. Second, the idea that cultural fabric is woven from small debts that will never be repaid exactly, and that repaying a debt exactly (rather than giving slightly too much or slightly too little) is something of a slight, since it means that you are trying to cut off your connection to that person.<li><em>Bird by Bird</em> by Anne Lamott: This is well written and interesting. It largely talks about a type of writing that I’m not very interested in doing, but it’s still a good read.<li><em>The Grammar of Graphics</em> by Leland Wilkinson: I’m reading this because I want to at some point make a statistical charting tool that doesn’t suck. I’m very early on in this book, but it’s quite good so far, and it’s clear that the author has spent a lot of time thinking about this topic, and has distilled a lot of useful insights in this book.<li><em>Fully Automated Luxury Communism</em> by Aaron Bastani: I’ve only read the introduction so far, but it seems very promising.</ul><p><picture><source srcset="/img/post/2021-10-recently/jay-mountain.webp" type="image/webp"><source srcset="/img/post/2021-10-recently/jay-mountain.jpg" type="image/jpeg"><img alt="A view of a mountain covered in trees with their leaves fallen off, with one bare stone face." src="/img/post/2021-10-recently/jay-mountain.jpg"></picture><p>In terms of online articles, here are some I found particularly interesting, insightful, or enjoyable:<ul><li><a href="https://mnartists.walkerart.org/meditation-on-sleep">Meditation on Sleep</a><li><a href="https://www.metafilter.com/192808/a-faraway-land-to-project-ones-romanticized-hopes#8154393">MeFi comment from cultanthropologist on the shifting meaning of the word “China” in political discussions</a><li><a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/8930.html">We’re already paying for it</a><li><a href="https://publicdomainreview.org/essay/illustrations-of-madness-james-tilly-matthews-and-the-air-loom">Illustrations of Madness: James Tilly Matthews and the Air Loom</a><li><a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/black-children-were-jailed-for-a-crime-that-doesnt-exist">Black Children Were Jailed for a Crime That Doesn’t Exist.
